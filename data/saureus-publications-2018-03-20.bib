  abstract = "During the last 2 decades, community-associated
              methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) strains
              have dramatically increased the global burden of S. aureus
              infections. The pandemic sequence type (ST)8/pulsed-field gel
              type USA300 is the dominant CA-MRSA clone in the United States,
              but its evolutionary history and basis for biological success are
              incompletely understood. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing of
              387 ST8 isolates drawn from an epidemiological network of CA-MRSA
              infections and colonizations in northern Manhattan to explore
              short-term evolution and transmission patterns. Phylogenetic
              analysis predicted that USA300 diverged from a most common recent
              ancestor around 1993. We found evidence for multiple
              introductions of USA300 and reconstructed the phylogeographic
              spread of isolates across neighborhoods. Using pair-wise
              single-nucleotide polymorphism distances as a measure of genetic
              relatedness between isolates, we observed that most USA300
              isolates had become endemic in households, indicating their
              critical role as reservoirs for transmission and diversification.
              Using the maximum single-nucleotide polymorphism variability of
              isolates from within households as a threshold, we identified
              several possible transmission networks beyond households. Our
              study also revealed the evolution of a fluoroquinolone-resistant
              subpopulation in the mid-1990s and its subsequent expansion at a
              time of high-frequency outpatient antibiotic use. This
              high-resolution phylogenetic analysis of ST8 has documented the
              genomic changes associated with USA300 evolution and how some of
              its recent evolution has been shaped by antibiotic use. By
              integrating whole-genome sequencing with detailed epidemiological
              analyses, our study provides an important framework for
              delineating the full diversity and spread of USA300 and other
              emerging pathogens in large urban community populations.",

               virulence factor that has been used as an antigen in several
               successful vaccines against bacterial pathogens. A vaccine has
               not yet been licensed against Staphylococcus aureus, although
               two multicomponent vaccines that contain CP antigens are in
               clinical trials. In this study, we evaluated CP production in
               USA300 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates that have
               become the predominant community-associated MRSA clones in the
               United States. We found that all 167 USA300 MRSA and 50 USA300
               methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were CP
               negative (CP(-)). Moreover, all 16 USA500 isolates, which have
               been postulated to be the progenitor lineage of USA300, were
               also CP(-). Whole-genome sequence analysis of 146 CP(-) USA300
               MRSA isolates revealed they all carry a cap5 locus with 4
               conserved mutations compared with strain Newman. Genetic
               complementation experiments revealed that three of these
               mutations (in the cap5 promoter, cap5D nucleotide 994, and cap5E
               nucleotide 223) ablated CP production in USA300 and that Cap5E75
               Asp, located in the coenzyme-binding domain, is essential for
               capsule production. All but three USA300 MSSA isolates had the
               same four cap5 mutations found in USA300 MRSA isolates. Most
               isolates with a USA500 pulsotype carried three of these four
               USA300-specific mutations, suggesting the fourth mutation
               occurred in the USA300 lineage. Phylogenetic analysis of the cap
               loci of our USA300 isolates as well as publicly available
               genomes from 41 other sequence types revealed that the
               USA300-specific cap5 mutations arose sequentially in S. aureus
               in a common ancestor of USA300 and USA500 isolates. IMPORTANCE:
               The USA300 MRSA clone emerged as a community-associated pathogen
               in the United States nearly 20 years ago. Since then, it has
               rapidly disseminated and now causes health care-associated
               infections. This study shows that the CP-negative (CP(-))
               phenotype has persisted among USA300 isolates and is a universal
               and characteristic trait of this highly successful MRSA lineage.
               It is important to note that a vaccine consisting solely of CP
               antigens would not likely demonstrate high efficacy in the U.S.
               population, where about half of MRSA isolates comprise USA300.
               Moreover, conversion of a USA300 strain to a CP-positive (CP(+))
               phenotype is unlikely in vivo or in vitro since it would require
               the reversion of 3 mutations. We have also established that
               USA300 MSSA isolates and USA500 isolates are CP(-) and provide
               new insight into the evolution of the USA300 and USA500

               USA300 is a successful S. aureus clone in the United States and
               a common cause of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). We
               performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 146 USA300 MRSA
               isolates from SSTIs and colonization cultures obtained from an
               investigation conducted from 2008 to 2010 in Chicago and Los
               Angeles households that included an index case with an S. aureus
               SSTI. Identifying unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
               and analyzing whole-genome phylogeny, we characterized isolates
               to understand transmission dynamics, genetic relatedness, and
               microevolution of USA300 MRSA within the households. We also
               compared the 146 USA300 MRSA isolates from our study with the
               previously published genome sequences of the USA300 MRSA
               isolates from San Diego (n = 35) and New York City (n = 277). We
               found little genetic variation within the USA300 MRSA household
               isolates from Los Angeles (mean number of SNPs $\pm$ standard
               deviation, 17.6 $\pm$ 35; $\pi$ nucleotide diversity, 3.1
               $\times$ 10(-5)) or from Chicago (mean number of SNPs $\pm$
               standard deviation, 12 $\pm$ 19; $\pi$ nucleotide diversity, 3.1
               $\times$ 10(-5)). The isolates within a household clustered into
               closely related monophyletic groups, suggesting the introduction
               into and transmission within each household of a single common
               USA300 ancestral strain. From a Bayesian evolutionary
               reconstruction, we inferred that USA300 persisted within
               households for 2.33 to 8.35 years prior to sampling. We also
               noted that fluoroquinolone-resistant USA300 clones emerged
               around 1995 and were more widespread in Los Angeles and New York
               City than in Chicago. Our findings strongly suggest that unique
               USA300 MRSA isolates are transmitted within households that
               contain an individual with an SSTI. Decolonization of household
               members may be a critical component of prevention programs to
               control USA300 MRSA spread in the United States. IMPORTANCE:
               USA300, a virulent and easily transmissible strain of
               methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), is the
               predominant community-associated MRSA clone in the United
               States. It most commonly causes skin infections but also causes
               necrotizing pneumonia and endocarditis. Strategies to limit the
               spread of MRSA in the community can only be effective if we
               understand the most common sources of transmission and the
               microevolutionary processes that provide a fitness advantage to
               MRSA. We performed a whole-genome sequence comparison of 146
               USA300 MRSA isolates from Chicago and Los Angeles. We show that
               households represent a frequent site of transmission and a
               long-term reservoir of USA300 strains; individuals within
               households transmit the same USA300 strain among themselves. Our
               study also reveals that a large proportion of the USA300
               isolates sequenced are resistant to fluoroquinolone antibiotics.
               The significance of this study is that if households serve as
               long-term reservoirs of USA300, household MRSA eradication
               programs may result in a uniquely effective control method.",

              (CA-MRSA) was recognized worldwide during the 1990s; in less than
              a decade, several genetically distinct CA-MRSA lineages carrying
              Panton-Valentine leukocidin genes have emerged on every
              continent. Most notably, in the United States, the sequence type
              18-IV (ST8-IV) clone known as USA300 has become highly prevalent,
              outcompeting methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and other
              MRSA strains in both community and hospital settings. CA-MRSA
              bacteria are much less prevalent in Europe, where the European
              ST80-IV European CA-MRSA clone, USA300 CA-MRSA strains, and other
              lineages, such as ST22-IV, coexist. The question that arises is
              whether the USA300 CA-MRSA present in Europe (i) was imported
              once or on very few occasions, followed by a broad geographic
              spread, anticipating an increased prevalence in the future, or
              (ii) derived from multiple importations with limited spreading
              success. In the present study, we applied whole-genome sequencing
              to a collection of French USA300 CA-MRSA strains responsible for
              sporadic cases and micro-outbreaks over the past decade and
              United States ST8 MSSA and MRSA isolates. Genome-wide
              phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the population structure
              of the French isolates is the product of multiple introductions
              dating back to the onset of the USA300 CA-MRSA clone in North
              America. Coalescent-based demography of the USA300 lineage shows
              that a strong expansion occurred during the 1990s concomitant
              with the acquisition of the arginine catabolic mobile element and
              antibiotic resistance, followed by a sharp decline initiated
              around 2008, reminiscent of the rise-and-fall pattern previously
              observed in the ST80 lineage. A future expansion of the USA300
              lineage in Europe is therefore very unlikely.IMPORTANCE To trace
              the origin, evolution, and dissemination pattern of the USA300
              CA-MRSA clone in France, we sequenced a collection of strains of
              this lineage from cases reported in France in the last decade and
              compared them with 431 ST8 strains from the United States. We
              determined that the French CA-MRSA USA300 sporadic and
              micro-outbreak isolates resulted from multiple independent
              introductions of the USA300 North American lineage. At a global
              level, in the transition from an MSSA lineage to a successful
              CA-MRSA clone, it first became resistant to multiple antibiotics
              and acquired the arginine catabolic mobile element and
              subsequently acquired resistance to fluoroquinolones, and these
              two steps were associated with a dramatic demographic expansion.
              This expansion was followed by the current stabilization and
              expected decline of this lineage. These findings highlight the
              significance of horizontal gene acquisitions and point mutations
              in the success of such disseminated clones and illustrate their
              cyclic and sporadic life cycle.",

              methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) BSIs for 2009-2013 at 2
              hospitals and used an adjusted incidence for modeling. WGS and

              phylogenetic reconstructions. Results.: On multivariate analysis,
              male sex, African-American race, and non-Hispanic white

              African-American race was significantly associated with HO-MRSA

              performed on colonizing USA300 MRSA isolates from 74 individuals
              within 72 hours of admission to a public hospital in Chicago, IL.
              Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were used to reconstruct the
              phylogeny of sequenced isolates, and epidemiologic data was
              overlaid to identify factors associated with transmission
              networks. RESULTS: The maximum within-patient SNV difference for
              an individual with multisite colonization was 41 SNVs, with no
              systematic divergence among body sites. We observed a minimum of
              7 SNVs and maximum of 153 SNVs between isolates from different
              individuals. We identified 4 pairs of individuals whose isolates
              were within 40 SNVs of each other. Putting our isolates in the
              context of previously sequenced USA300 isolates from other
              communities, we identified a 13-member group and two 4-member
              groups that represent samples from putative local transmission
              networks. Individuals in these groups were more likely to be
              African American, to be human immunodeficiency virus-infected, to
              reside in high detainee release areas, and to be current users of
              illicit drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Using WGS, we observed potential
              transmission networks in an urban community and that certain
              epidemiologic factors were associated with inclusion in these
              networks. Future work with contact tracing and advanced molecular

              conducted a molecular epidemiologic analysis to identify the
              origin of a sudden increase of ST8 PVL-positive isolates in
              Geneva during 2013. METHODS: On the basis of prospective CA-MRSA
              surveillance, we collected colonizing and infecting ST8-USA300
              isolates and compared them to non-ST8 CA-MRSA isolates.
              Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed for each isolate of
              this collection, and discriminating molecular features were
              linked to patient data. RESULTS: In 2013, 22 isolates with the
              ST8-USA300 profile were identified among 46 cases of CA-MRSA. WGS

               isolates belonging to clonal complex 8 (CC8), derived from the
               Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial program. Isolates
               were collected at 12 healthcare centres across nine USA states
               in 2004, 2009 or 2010. Reconstruction of evolutionary
               relationships revealed that CC8 was dominated by USA300 isolates
               (154/191, 81 \%), which were heterogeneous and demonstrated
               limited phylogeographic clustering. Analysis of the USA300 core
               genomes revealed an increase in median pairwise SNP distance
               from 62 to 98 between 2004 and 2010, with a stable pattern of
               above average dN/dS ratios. The phylogeny of the USA300

              dissemination of ST8, including USA300. Analyses of core SNP
              diversity and accessory genome variations showed that the
              ancestor of all ST8 S. aureus most likely emerged in Central
              Europe in the mid-19th century. From here, ST8 was exported to
              North America in the early 20th century and progressively

              a prominent cause of infections globally. The high incidence of
              S. aureus infections is compounded by the ability of the microbe
              to readily acquire resistance to antibiotics. In the United
              States, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a leading cause
              of morbidity and mortality by a single infectious agent.
              Therapeutic options for severe MRSA infections are limited to a
              few antibiotics to which the organism is typically susceptible,
              including vancomycin. Acquisition of high-level vancomycin
              resistance by MRSA is a major concern, but to date, there have
              been only 12 vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) isolates

              pathogens is an important veterinary and public health issue.
              Staphylococcus aureus is a notorious human pathogen associated
              with serious nosocomial and community-acquired infections. In
              addition, S. aureus is a major cause of animal diseases including
              skeletal infections of poultry, which are a large economic burden
              on the global broiler chicken industry. Here, we provide evidence
              that the majority of S. aureus isolates from broiler chickens are
              the descendants of a single human-to-poultry host jump that
              occurred approximately 38 years ago (range, 30 to 63 years ago)
              by a subtype of the worldwide human ST5 clonal lineage unique to
              Poland. In contrast to human subtypes of the ST5 radiation, which
              demonstrate strong geographic clustering, the poultry ST5 clade
              was distributed in different continents, consistent with wide
              dissemination via the global poultry industry distribution
              network. The poultry ST5 clade has undergone genetic
              diversification from its human progenitor strain by acquisition
              of novel mobile genetic elements from an avian-specific accessory
              gene pool, and by the inactivation of several proteins important
              for human disease pathogenesis. These genetic events have
              resulted in enhanced resistance to killing by chicken
              heterophils, reflecting avian host-adaptive evolution. Taken
              together, we have determined the evolutionary history of a major
              new animal pathogen that has undergone rapid avian host
              adaptation and intercontinental dissemination. These data provide
              a new paradigm for the impact of human activities on the

               altered S. aureus antimicrobial resistance or the small colony

               strikingly, a single nucleotide substitution in relA (SACOL1689)
               reduced RelA hydrolase activity and caused accumulation of the

               impact of an active stringent response in S. aureus, which was
               associated with reduced growth, and attenuated virulence in the

              bacterial pathogens and the etiology of bacterial disease.
              Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of bacteria-associated
              mortality and invasive disease and is carried asymptomatically by
              27\% of adults. Eighty percent of bacteremias match the carried
              strain. However, the role of evolutionary change in the pathogen
              during the progression from carriage to disease is incompletely
              understood. Here we use high-throughput genome sequencing to
              discover the genetic changes that accompany the transition from
              nasal carriage to fatal bloodstream infection in an individual
              colonized with methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. We found a
              single, cohesive population exhibiting a repertoire of 30
              single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four insertion/deletion
              variants. Mutations accumulated at a steady rate over a 13-mo
              period, except for a cluster of mutations preceding the
              transition to disease. Although bloodstream bacteria differed by
              just eight mutations from the original nasally carried bacteria,
              half of those mutations caused truncation of proteins, including
              a premature stop codon in an AraC-family transcriptional
              regulator that has been implicated in pathogenicity. Comparison
              with evolution in two asymptomatic carriers supported the
              conclusion that clusters of protein-truncating mutations are
              highly unusual. Our results demonstrate that bacterial diversity
              in vivo is limited but nonetheless detectable by whole-genome
              sequencing, enabling the study of evolutionary dynamics within
              the host. Regulatory or structural changes that occur during
              carriage may be functionally important for pathogenesis;
              therefore identifying those changes is a crucial step in
              understanding the biological causes of invasive bacterial
              disease.",

              Whole-genome sequencing may provide improved resolution to define
              transmission pathways and characterize outbreaks.METHODS:We
              investigated a putative MRSA outbreak in a neonatal intensive
              care unit. By using rapid high-throughput sequencing technology
              with a clinically relevant turnaround time, we retrospectively
              sequenced the DNA from seven isolates associated with the
              outbreak and another seven MRSA isolates associated with carriage
              of MRSA or bacteremia in the same hospital.RESULTS:We constructed
              a phylogenetic tree by comparing single-nucleotide polymorphisms
              (SNPs) in the core genome to a reference genome (an epidemic MRSA
              clone, EMRSA-15 [sequence type 22]). This revealed a distinct
              cluster of outbreak isolates and clear separation between these
              and the nonoutbreak isolates. A previously missed transmission
              event was detected between two patients with bacteremia who were
              not part of the outbreak. We created an artificial ``resistome''
              of antibiotic-resistance genes and demonstrated concordance
              between it and the results of phenotypic susceptibility testing;
              we also created a ``toxome'' consisting of toxin genes. One
              outbreak isolate had a hypermutator phenotype with a higher
              number of SNPs than the other outbreak isolates, highlighting the
              difficulty of imposing a simple threshold for the number of SNPs
              between isolates to decide whether they are part of a recent
              transmission chain.CONCLUSIONS:Whole-genome sequencing can
              provide clinically relevant data within a time frame that can
              influence patient care. The need for automated data
              interpretation and the provision of clinically meaningful reports

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is a pathogen that causes food
              poisoning and community-associated infection with antibiotic
              resistance. This species is an indigenous intestinal microbe
              found in infants and not found in adult intestine. The relatively
              small genome size and rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance
              genes in the species have been drawing an increasing attention in
              public health. To extend our understanding of the species and use
              the genome data for comparative genomic studies, we sequenced the
              type strain of S. aureus subsp. aureus DSM 20231T. RESULTS:
              Seventeen contigs were generated using hybrid assembly of
              sequences derived from the Roche 454 and Illumina systems. The
              length of the genome sequence was 2,902,619 bases with a G + C
              content of 32.8\%. Among the 2,550 annotated CDSs, 44 CDSs were
              annotated to antibiotic resistance genes and 13 CDSs were related
              to methicillin resistance. It is interesting to note that this
              strain was first isolated in 1884 before methicillin was
              generally used on patients. CONCLUSIONS: The present study
              analyzed the genome sequence of S. aureus subsp. aureus type
              strain as the reference sequence for comparative genomic analyses
              of clinical isolates. Methicillin resistance genes found in the
              genome indicate the presence of antibiotic resistance mechanism
              prior to the usage of antibiotics. Further comparative genomic
              studies of methicillin-resistant strains based on this reference
              genome would help to understand the evolution of resistance

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of healthcare
               associated mortality, but like many important bacterial
               pathogens, it is a common constituent of the normal human body
               flora. Around a third of healthy adults are carriers. Recent
               evidence suggests that evolution of S. aureus during nasal
               carriage may be associated with progression to invasive disease.
               However, a more detailed understanding of within-host evolution
               under natural conditions is required to appreciate the
               evolutionary and mechanistic reasons why commensal bacteria such
               as S. aureus cause disease. Therefore we examined in detail the
               evolutionary dynamics of normal, asymptomatic carriage.
               Sequencing a total of 131 genomes across 13 singly colonized
               hosts using the Illumina platform, we investigated diversity,
               selection, population dynamics and transmission during the
               short-term evolution of S. aureus. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We
               characterized the processes by which the raw material for
               evolution is generated: micro-mutation (point mutation and small
               insertions/deletions), macro-mutation (large
               insertions/deletions) and the loss or acquisition of mobile
               elements (plasmids and bacteriophages). Through an analysis of
               synonymous, non-synonymous and intergenic mutations we
               discovered a fitness landscape dominated by purifying selection,
               with rare examples of adaptive change in genes encoding
               surface-anchored proteins and an enterotoxin. We found evidence
               for dramatic, hundred-fold fluctuations in the size of the
               within-host population over time, which we related to the cycle
               of colonization and clearance. Using a newly-developed
               population genetics approach to detect recent transmission among
               hosts, we revealed evidence for recent transmission between some
               of our subjects, including a husband and wife both carrying
               populations of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).
               SIGNIFICANCE: This investigation begins to paint a picture of
               the within-host evolution of an important bacterial pathogen
               during its prevailing natural state, asymptomatic carriage.
               These results also have wider significance as a benchmark for
               future systematic studies of evolution during invasive S. aureus
               disease.",

               content group of the Firmicutes division of bacteria.
               Staphylococcus aureus is an important human and veterinary
               pathogen that causes a broad spectrum of diseases, and has
               developed important multidrug resistant forms such as
               methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Staphylococcus simiae
               was isolated from South American squirrel monkeys in 2000, and
               is a coagulase-negative bacterium, closely related, and possibly
               the sister group, to S. aureus. Comparative genomic analyses of
               closely related bacteria with different phenotypes can provide
               information relevant to understanding adaptation to host
               environment and mechanisms of pathogenicity.RESULTS:We
               determined a Roche/454 draft genome sequence for S. simiae and
               included it in comparative genomic analyses with 11 other
               Staphylococcus species including S. aureus. A genome based
               phylogeny of the genus confirms that S. simiae is the sister
               group to S. aureus and indicates that the most basal
               Staphylococcus lineage is Staphylococcus pseudintermedius,
               followed by Staphylococcus carnosus. Given the primary niche of
               these two latter taxa, compared to the other species in the
               genus, this phylogeny suggests that human adaptation evolved
               after the split of S. carnosus. The two coagulase-positive
               species (S. aureus and S. pseudintermedius) are not
               phylogenetically closest but share many virulence factors
               exclusively, suggesting that these genes were acquired by
               horizontal transfer. Enrichment in genes related to mobile
               elements such as prophage in S. aureus relative to S. simiae
               suggests that pathogenesis in the S. aureus group has developed
               by gene gain through horizontal transfer, after the split of S.
               aureus and S. simiae from their common
               ancestor.CONCLUSIONS:Comparative genomic analyses across 12
               Staphylococcus species provide hypotheses about lineages in
               which human adaptation has taken place and contributions of
               horizontal transfer in pathogenesis.",

              evolution thought to explain most of the virulence differences
              between strains. First, virulence genes may be acquired from
              other organisms. Second, mutations may cause changes in the

              direct impact on virulence gene regulation resulting in
              hypervirulence. Whole-genome analysis of a methicillin-resistant
              S. aureus (MRSA) strain USA500 revealed acquisition of a
              transposable element (IS256) that is absent from close relatives

              responsible for the expression of virulence factors in S. aureus.
              We show that insertion into the rot promoter by IS256 results in

  abstract = "Staphylococcus aureus is a commensal and major pathogen of humans
              and animals. Comparative genomics of S. aureus populations
              suggests that colonization of different host species is
              associated with carriage of mobile genetic elements (MGE),
              particularly bacteriophages and plasmids capable of encoding
              virulence, resistance, and immune evasion pathways.
              Antimicrobial-resistant S. aureus of livestock are a potential
              zoonotic threat to human health if they adapt to colonize humans
              efficiently. We utilized the technique of experimental evolution
              and co-colonized gnotobiotic piglets with both human- and
              pig-associated variants of the lineage clonal complex 398, and
              investigated growth and genetic changes over 16 days using whole
              genome sequencing. The human isolate survived co-colonization on
              piglets more efficiently than in vitro. During co-colonization,
              transfer of MGE from the pig to the human isolate was detected
              within 4 h. Extensive and repeated transfer of two bacteriophages
              and three plasmids resulted in colonization with isolates
              carrying a wide variety of mobilomes. Whole genome sequencing of
              progeny bacteria revealed no acquisition of core genome
              polymorphisms, highlighting the importance of MGE. Staphylococcus
              aureus bacteriophage recombination and integration into novel
              sites was detected experimentally for the first time. During
              colonization, clones coexisted and diversified rather than a
              single variant dominating. Unexpectedly, each piglet carried
              unique populations of bacterial variants, suggesting limited
              transmission of bacteria between piglets once colonized. Our data
              show that horizontal gene transfer occurs at very high frequency

  abstract = "Staphylococcus aureus is a human commensal bacterium and a
              prominent cause of infections globally. The high incidence of S.
              aureus infections is compounded by the ability of the microbe to
              readily acquire resistance to antibiotics. In the United States,
              methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a leading cause of
              morbidity and mortality by a single infectious agent. Therapeutic
              options for severe MRSA infections are limited to a few
              antibiotics to which the organism is typically susceptible,
              including vancomycin. Acquisition of high-level vancomycin
              resistance by MRSA is a major concern, but to date, there have
              been only 12 vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) isolates

              which was first detected in the UK in the early 1990s and

              the potential of pathogen genome sequencing as a diagnostic tool.

              aureus (MRSA), designated community-acquired MRSA, is becoming
              increasingly noticeable in the community, some strains of which
              cause fatal infections in otherwise healthy individuals. By
              contrast with hospital-acquired MRSA, community-acquired MRSA is
              more susceptible to non b-lactam antibiotics. We investigated the
              high virulence potential of certain strains of this bacterium.
              METHODS: We ascertained the whole genome sequence of MW2, a
              strain of community-acquired MRSA, by shotgun cloning and
              sequencing. MW2 caused fatal septicaemia and septic arthritis in
              a 16-month-old girl in North Dakota, USA, in 1998. The genome of
              this strain was compared with those of hospital-acquired MRSA
              strains, including N315 and Mu50. FINDINGS: Meticillin resistance
              gene (mecA) in MW2 was carried by a novel allelic form (type IVa)
              of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), by contrast
              with type II in N315 and Mu50. Type IVa SCCmec did not carry any
              of the multiple antibiotic resistance genes reported in type II
              SCCmec. By contrast, 19 additional virulence genes were recorded
              in the MW2 genome. All but two of these virulence genes were
              noted in four of the seven genomic islands of MW2.
              INTERPRETATION: MW2 carried a range of virulence and resistance
              genes that was distinct from those displayed on the chromosomes
              of extant S aureus strains. Most genes were carried by specific
              allelic forms of genomic islands in the MW2 chromosome. The
              combination of allelic forms of genomic islands is the genetic
              basis that determines the pathogenicity of medically important

              agent of infections often associated with implanted medical
              devices. We have sequenced the approximately 2.8-Mb genome of S.
              aureus COL, an early methicillin-resistant isolate, and the
              approximately 2.6-Mb genome of S. epidermidis RP62a, a
              methicillin-resistant biofilm isolate. Comparative analysis of
              these and other staphylococcal genomes was used to explore the
              evolution of virulence and resistance between these two species.
              The S. aureus and S. epidermidis genomes are syntenic throughout
              their lengths and share a core set of 1,681 open reading frames.
              Genome islands in nonsyntenic regions are the primary source of
              variations in pathogenicity and resistance. Gene transfer between
              staphylococci and low-GC-content gram-positive bacteria appears
              to have shaped their virulence and resistance profiles.
              Integrated plasmids in S. epidermidis carry genes encoding
              resistance to cadmium and species-specific LPXTG surface
              proteins. A novel genome island encodes multiple phenol-soluble

              epidermidis contains the cap operon, encoding the polyglutamate

              S aureus to try to identify genes responsible for its distinctive
              epidemiological and virulence properties. METHODS: We ascertained
              the genome sequence of FPR3757, a multidrug resistant USA300
              strain, by random shotgun sequencing, then compared it with the
              sequences of ten other staphylococcal strains. FINDINGS: Compared
              with closely related S aureus, we noted that almost all of the
              unique genes in USA300 clustered in novel allotypes of mobile
              genetic elements. Some of the unique genes are involved in
              pathogenesis, including Panton-Valentine leucocidin and molecular
              variants of enterotoxin Q and K. The most striking feature of the
              USA300 genome is the horizontal acquisition of a novel mobile
              genetic element that encodes an arginine deiminase pathway and an
              oligopeptide permease system that could contribute to growth and
              survival of USA300. We did not detect this element, termed
              arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME), in other S aureus

              suggesting not only that ACME transfers into USA300 from S
              epidermidis, but also that this element confers a selective
              advantage to this ubiquitous commensal of the human skin.

              isolates from the United Kingdom (Scotland), along with publicly
              available genomes. Using state-of-the-art methods for mapping
              traits onto phylogenies, we quantified transitions between host
              species to identify sink and source populations for CC398 and
              employed a novel approach to investigate the gain and loss of
              antibiotic resistance in CC398 over time. We identified distinct
              human- and livestock-associated CC398 clades and observed
              multiple transmissions of CC398 from livestock to humans and
              between countries, lending quantitative support to previous
              reports. Of note, we identified a subclade within the
              livestock-associated clade comprised of isolates from hospital
              environments and newborn babies, suggesting that
              livestock-associated CC398 is capable of onward transmission in
              hospitals. In addition, our analysis revealed significant
              differences in the dynamics of resistance to methicillin and
              tetracycline related to contrasting historical patterns of
              antibiotic usage between the livestock industry and human
              medicine. We also identified significant differences in patterns

              determinants, which we ascribe to epistatic interactions between
              the resistance genes and/or differences in the modes of
              inheritance of the resistance determinants.",

              analysis of 12 MSSA and 44 MRSA ST93 isolates, collected from
              around Australia over a 17-year period. Comparative analysis
              revealed a core genome of 2.6 Mb, sharing greater than 99.7\%
              nucleotide identity. The accessory genome was 0.45 Mb and
              comprised additional mobile DNA elements, harboring resistance to
              erythromycin, trimethoprim and tetracycline. Phylogenetic
              inference revealed a molecular clock and suggested that a single
              clone of methicillin susceptible, Panton-Valentine leukocidin
              (PVL) positive, ST93 S. aureus likely spread from North Western
              Australia in the early 1970s, acquiring methicillin resistance at
              least twice in the mid 1990s. We also explored associations
              between genotype and important MRSA phenotypes including
              oxacillin MIC and production of exotoxins ($\alpha$-hemolysin,
              $\delta$-hemolysin, PSM$\alpha$3, and PVL). High-level expression
              of $\alpha$-hemolysin is a signature feature of ST93 and reduced
              expression in eight isolates was readily explained by mutations
              in the agr locus. However, subtle but significant decreases in
              $\delta$-hemolysin were also noted over time that coincided with
              decreasing oxacillin resistance and were independent of agr
              mutations. The evolution of ST93 S. aureus is thus associated
              with a reduction in both exotoxin expression and oxacillin MIC,
              suggesting MRSA ST93 isolates are under pressure for adaptive

              genetic elements encoding determinants involved in niche
              adaptation. The genomic islands $\nu$Sa$\alpha$ and
              $\nu$Sa$\beta$ are found in almost all S. aureus strains and are

              staphylococcal superantigens, proteases, and leukotoxins, in

              healthcare-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus

              treatment. One example is Singapore, where MRSA ST239, the
              dominant clone since molecular profiling of MRSA began in the
              mid-1980s, has been replaced by ST22 isolates belonging to
              EMRSA-15, a recently emerged pandemic lineage originating from
              Europe. RESULTS: We investigated the population structure of MRSA
              in Singaporean hospitals spanning three decades, using whole
              genome sequencing. Applying Bayesian phylogenetic methods we
              report that prior to the introduction of ST22, the ST239 MRSA
              population in Singapore originated from multiple introductions
              from the surrounding region; it was frequently transferred within
              the healthcare system resulting in a heterogeneous hospital
              population. Following the introduction of ST22 around the
              beginning of the millennium, this clone spread rapidly through
              Singaporean hospitals, supplanting the endemic ST239 population.
              Coalescent analysis revealed that although the genetic diversity
              of ST239 initially decreased as ST22 became more dominant, from
              2007 onwards the genetic diversity of ST239 began to increase
              once more, which was not associated with the emergence of a
              sub-clone of ST239. Comparative genomic analysis of the accessory
              genome of the extant ST239 population identified that the
              Arginine Catabolic Mobile Element arose multiple times, thereby
              introducing genes associated with enhanced skin colonization into
              this population. CONCLUSIONS: Our results clearly demonstrate
              that, alongside clinical practice and antibiotic usage,
              competition between clones also has an important role in driving

              sheep to coagulate ruminant plasma, reported over 60 years ago,
              led to the description of small ruminant and bovine S. aureus

              its host tropism remain unknown. Here, we provide evidence that
              the CC133 clone evolved as the result of a human to ruminant host
              jump followed by adaptive genome diversification. Comparative
              whole-genome sequencing revealed molecular evidence for host

              community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections. It produces
              numerous toxins including superantigens that cause unique disease
              entities such as toxic-shock syndrome and staphylococcal scarlet
              fever, and has acquired resistance to practically all
              antibiotics. Whole genome analysis is a necessary step towards
              future development of countermeasures against this organism.
              METHODS: Whole genome sequences of two related S aureus strains
              (N315 and Mu50) were determined by shot-gun random sequencing.
              N315 is a meticillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) strain isolated in
              1982, and Mu50 is an MRSA strain with vancomycin resistance
              isolated in 1997. The open reading frames were identified by use
              of GAMBLER and GLIMMER programs, and annotation of each was done
              with a BLAST homology search, motif analysis, and protein
              localisation prediction. FINDINGS: The Staphylococcus genome was
              composed of a complex mixture of genes, many of which seem to
              have been acquired by lateral gene transfer. Most of the
              antibiotic resistance genes were carried either by plasmids or by
              mobile genetic elements including a unique resistance island.
              Three classes of new pathogenicity islands were identified in the
              genome: a toxic-shock-syndrome toxin island family, exotoxin
              islands, and enterotoxin islands. In the latter two pathogenicity
              islands, clusters of exotoxin and enterotoxin genes were found
              closely linked with other gene clusters encoding putative
              pathogenic factors. The analysis also identified 70 candidates
              for new virulence factors. INTERPRETATION: The remarkable ability
              of S aureus to acquire useful genes from various organisms was
              revealed through the observation of genome complexity and
              evidence of lateral gene transfer. Repeated duplication of genes
              encoding superantigens explains why S aureus is capable of
              infecting humans of diverse genetic backgrounds, eliciting severe
              immune reactions. Investigation of many newly identified gene
              products, including the 70 putative virulence factors, will
              greatly improve our understanding of the biology of staphylococci

               proposed a preliminary model called ECM+RMCG for the VISA

               phenotype, intricately linked to a pathogen's evolutionary
               trajectory. Toxicity, the ability to destroy host cell
               membranes, and adhesion, the ability to adhere to human tissues,
               are the major virulence factors of many bacterial pathogens,
               including Staphylococcus aureus. Here, we assayed the toxicity
               and adhesiveness of 90 MRSA (methicillin resistant S. aureus)
               isolates and found that while there was remarkably little
               variation in adhesion, toxicity varied by over an order of
               magnitude between isolates, suggesting different evolutionary
               selection pressures acting on these two traits. We performed a

              evolution are largely unknown. The speed with which genetic
              change accumulates in populations of pathogenic bacteria,
              however, is a key parameter that is crucial for understanding the
              emergence of traits such as increased virulence or antibiotic
              resistance, together with the forces driving pathogen spread.
              Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common
              cause of hospital-acquired infections. We have investigated an
              MRSA strain (ST225) that is highly prevalent in hospitals in
              Central Europe. By using mutation discovery at 269 genetic loci
              (118,804 basepairs) within an international isolate collection,
              we ascertained extremely low diversity among European ST225
              isolates, indicating that a recent population bottleneck had
              preceded the expansion of this clone. In contrast, US isolates
              were more divergent, suggesting they represent the ancestral
              population. While diversity was low, however, our results
              demonstrate that the short-term evolutionary rate in this natural
              population of MRSA resulted in the accumulation of measurable DNA
              sequence variation within two decades, which we could exploit to
              reconstruct its recent demographic history and the spatiotemporal
              dynamics of spread. By applying Bayesian coalescent methods on
              DNA sequences serially sampled through time, we estimated that
              ST225 had diverged since approximately 1990 (1987 to 1994), and
              that expansion of the European clade began in 1995 (1991 to
              1999), several years before the new clone was recognized.
              Demographic analysis based on DNA sequence variation indicated a
              sharp increase of bacterial population size from 2001 to 2004,
              which is concordant with the reported prevalence of this strain
              in several European countries. A detailed ancestry-based
              reconstruction of the spatiotemporal dispersal dynamics suggested
              a pattern of frequent transmission of the ST225 clone among
              hospitals within Central Europe. In addition, comparative

               aureus (MRSA) that can persist in the community and replace
               existing hospital-adapted lineages of MRSA means that it is
               necessary to understand transmission dynamics in terms of
               hospitals and the community as one entity. We assessed the use
               of whole-genome sequencing to enhance detection of MRSA
               transmission between these settings. METHODS: We studied a
               putative MRSA outbreak on a special care baby unit (SCBU) at a
               National Health Service Foundation Trust in Cambridge, UK. We
               used whole-genome sequencing to validate and expand findings
               from an infection-control team who assessed the outbreak through
               conventional analysis of epidemiological data and antibiogram
               profiles. We sequenced isolates from all colonised patients in
               the SCBU, and sequenced MRSA isolates from patients in the
               hospital or community with the same antibiotic susceptibility
               profile as the outbreak strain. FINDINGS: The hospital
               infection-control team identified 12 infants colonised with MRSA
               in a 6 month period in 2011, who were suspected of being linked,
               but a persistent outbreak could not be confirmed with
               conventional methods. With whole-genome sequencing, we
               identified 26 related cases of MRSA carriage, and showed
               transmission occurred within the SCBU, between mothers on a
               postnatal ward, and in the community. The outbreak MRSA type was
               a new sequence type (ST) 2371, which is closely related to ST22,
               but contains genes encoding Panton-Valentine leucocidin.
               Whole-genome sequencing data were used to propose and confirm
               that MRSA carriage by a staff member had allowed the outbreak to
               persist during periods without known infection on the SCBU and
               after a deep clean. INTERPRETATION: Whole-genome sequencing
               holds great promise for rapid, accurate, and comprehensive
               identification of bacterial transmission pathways in hospital
               and community settings, with concomitant reductions in

               infection in hospitals focus on patient-to-patient transmission.
               We used whole-genome sequencing to investigate the role of
               colonized patients as the source of new S. aureus acquisitions,
               and the reliability of identifying patient-to-patient
               transmission using the conventional approach of spa typing and
               overlapping patient stay. METHODS: Over 14 months, all
               unselected patients admitted to an adult intensive care unit
               (ICU) were serially screened for S. aureus. All available
               isolates (n = 275) were spa typed and underwent whole-genome
               sequencing to investigate their relatedness at high resolution.
               RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was carried by 185 of 1109
               patients sampled within 24 hours of ICU admission (16.7\%); 59
               (5.3\%) patients carried methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).
               Forty-four S. aureus (22 MRSA) acquisitions while on ICU were
               detected. Isolates were available for genetic analysis from 37
               acquisitions. Whole-genome sequencing indicated that 7 of these
               37 (18.9\%) were transmissions from other colonized patients.
               Conventional methods (spa typing combined with overlapping
               patient stay) falsely identified 3 patient-to-patient
               transmissions (all MRSA) and failed to detect 2 acquisitions and
               4 transmissions (2 MRSA). CONCLUSIONS: Only a minority of S.
               aureus acquisitions can be explained by patient-to-patient
               transmission. Whole-genome sequencing provides the resolution to
               disprove transmission events indicated by conventional methods
               and also to reveal otherwise unsuspected transmission events.

               changes. We therefore compared the whole genome sequences of
               four sets of S. aureus isolates. Three sets were from the same

               other and the isolate from infection caused skin infections. The
               isolates were then compared for differences in gene content and
               SNPs. In addition, a set of isolates from a colonized pig and a
               farmer from the same farm at the same time (S0462 and S0460)
               were analyzed. The isolates pair S1800/S1805 showed a difference
               in a prophage, but these are easily lost or acquired. However,
               S1805 contained an integrative conjugative element not present
               in S1800. In addition, 92 SNPs were present in a variety of
               genes and the isolates S1800 and S1805 were not considered a
               pair. Between S2395/S2396 two SNPs were present: one was in an
               intergenic region and one was a synonymous mutation in a
               putative membrane protein. Between S2397/S2398 only one

               farm isolates were very similar and showed 12 SNPs in genes that
               belong to a number of different functional categories. However,
               we cannot pinpoint any gene that explains the change from
               carrier status to infection. The data indicate that differences

               recognized as a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections.
               Community-associated S. aureus (CA-SA) pose a greater threat due
               to increase in severity of infection and disease among children
               and healthy adults. CA-SA strains in India are genetically
               diverse, among which is the sequence type (ST) 772, which has
               now spread to Australia, Europe and Japan. Towards understanding
               the genetic characteristics of ST772, we obtained draft genome
               sequences of five relevant clinical isolates and studied the
               properties of their PVL-carrying prophages, whose presence is a
               defining hallmark of CA-SA. We show that this is a novel
               prophage, which carries the structural genes of the hlb-carrying
               prophage and includes the sea enterotoxin. This architecture
               probably emerged early within the ST772 lineage, at least in
               India. The sea gene, unique to ST772 PVL, despite having
               promoter sequence characteristics typical of low expression,
               appears to be highly expressed during early phase of growth in
               laboratory conditions. We speculate that this might be a
               consequence of its novel sequence context. The crippled nature
               of the hlb-converting prophage in ST772 suggests that widespread
               mobility of the sea enterotoxin might be a selective force
               behind its 'transfer' to the PVL prophage. Wild type ST772
               strains induced strong proliferative responses as well as high
               cytotoxic activity against neutrophils, likely mediated by
               superantigen SEA and the PVL toxin respectively. Both
               proliferation and cytotoxicity were markedly reduced in a cured
               ST772 strain indicating the impact of the phage on virulence.
               The presence of SEA alongside the genes for the immune
               system-modulating PVL toxin may contribute to the success and
               virulence of ST772.",

               powerful tool for understanding both patterns of descent over
               time and space (phylogeography) and the molecular processes
               underpinning genome divergence in pathogenic bacteria. Here, we
               describe a synthesis between these perspectives by employing a
               recently developed Bayesian approach, BRATNextGen, for detecting
               recombination on an expanded NGS dataset of the globally
               disseminated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
               clone ST239. RESULTS: The data confirm strong geographical
               clustering at continental, national and city scales and
               demonstrate that the rate of recombination varies significantly
               between phylogeographic sub-groups representing independent
               introductions from Europe. These differences are most striking
               when mobile non-core genes are included, but remain apparent
               even when only considering the stable core genome. The
               monophyletic ST239 sub-group corresponding to isolates from
               South America shows heightened recombination, the sub-group
               predominantly from Asia shows an intermediate level, and a very
               low level of recombination is noted in a third sub-group
               representing a large collection from Turkey. CONCLUSIONS: We
               show that the rapid global dissemination of a single pathogenic
               bacterial clone results in local variation in measured
               recombination rates. Possible explanatory variables include the
               size and time since emergence of each defined sub-population (as
               determined by the sampling frame), variation in transmission
               dynamics due to host movement, and changes in the bacterial

              that could reduce the delay between pathogen sampling and data
              generation is single molecule sequencing. An example of this
              technology, which is undergoing evaluation through an early
              access programme, is the Oxford Nanopore MinION. METHODS: We
              undertook a feasibility study on six clinically significant
              pathogens, comparing the MinION to the Illumina MiSeq and PacBio
              RSII platforms. Genomic DNA was prepared and sequenced using the
              MinION as instructed by the manufacturer, and Illumina MiSeq and
              PacBio sequencing was performed using established methods.
              RESULTS: An evaluation of the accuracy of the MinION based on
              sequencing of an MRSA isolate showed that error rates were higher
              in the MinION reads, but provided an even coverage across the
              entire genome length. The MinION detected all of the expected
              carbapenemases and ESBL genes in five Gram-negative isolates and
              the mecA gene in an MRSA isolate. CONCLUSIONS: The MinION can
              detect the presence of acquired resistance genes, but
              improvements in accuracy are needed so that antimicrobial

              genetically distinct, differing at 24\% average nucleotide
              divergence in 1,478 core genes. To better understand the genome
              dynamics of these ecologically similar staphylococcal species, we
              carried out a comparative analysis of 324 S. aureus and S.
              epidermidis genomes, including 83 novel S. epidermidis sequences.
              A reference pan-genome approach and whole genome

              24\% of the core genes in S. aureus. Homologous recombination

              emerged as important colonizers of livestock. These strains also
              represent an increasing cause of human infections. A recent study
              reporting a new dominant spa type among MRSA from Finish

              growth, hemolysis and adhesive capacity, and to provide data on
              its genomic background. To this end, growth curves and hemolysis
              patterns were generated and adhesion assays on human keratinocyte

              agr-positive, fnbB-negative CC398/t2741 strain from the same pig
              herd, an agr/fnbB- positive CC398/t034 strain from another pig

              strains, cytotoxic effects on porcine mucosal cells were

              agr-negative livestock-associated MRSA, in combination with
              diminished cytotoxic effects, is likely favorable for inducing
              persistent colonization in pigs. Independently of the host cell
              type, similar adhesive capacities of the naturally agr-negative
              livestock-associated MRSA and the human MRSA strain were shown.
              Our results indicate that loss of agr in the livestock-associated

              used to elucidate the origin and dynamics of a long-term outbreak
              of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sequence
              type 228 (ST228) SCCmec I that involved 1,600 patients in a
              tertiary care hospital between 2008 and 2012. Combining of the
              sequence data with detailed metadata on patient admission and
              movement confirmed that the outbreak was due to the transmission
              of a single clonal variant of ST228, rather than repeated
              introductions of this clone into the hospital. We note that this
              clone is significantly more frequently recovered from groin and
              rectal swabs than other clones (P < 0.0001) and is also
              significantly more transmissible between roommates (P < 0.01).
              Unrecognized MRSA carriers, together with movements of patients
              within the hospital, also seem to have played a major role. These
              atypical colonization and transmission dynamics can help explain
              how the outbreak was maintained over the long term. This
              ``stealthy'' asymptomatic colonization of the gut, combined with
              heightened transmissibility (potentially reflecting a role for
              environmental reservoirs), means the dynamics of this outbreak
              share some properties with enteric pathogens such as
              vancomycin-resistant enterococci or Clostridium difficile.
              IMPORTANCE: Using whole-genome sequencing, we showed that a large
              and prolonged outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
              aureus was due to the clonal spread of a specific strain with
              genetic elements adapted to the hospital environment.
              Unrecognized MRSA carriers, the movement of patients within the
              hospital, and the low detection with clinical specimens were also
              factors that played a role in this occurrence. The atypical
              colonization of the gut means the dynamics of this outbreak may
              share some properties with enteric pathogens.",

              one of the most common healthcare-associated pathogens. To
              examine the role of inter-hospital patient sharing on MRSA
              transmission, a previous study collected 2,214 samples from 30
              hospitals in Orange County, California and showed by spa typing
              that genetic differentiation decreased significantly with
              increased patient sharing. In the current study, we focused on
              the 986 samples with spa type t008 from the same population.
              METHODS: We used genome sequencing to determine the effect of
              patient sharing on genetic differentiation between hospitals.
              Genetic differentiation was measured by between-hospital genetic
              diversity, F ST , and the proportion of nearly identical isolates
              between hospitals. RESULTS: Surprisingly, we found very similar
              genetic diversity within and between hospitals, and no
              significant association between patient sharing and genetic
              differentiation measured by F ST . However, in contrast to F ST ,
              there was a significant association between patient sharing and
              the proportion of nearly identical isolates between hospitals. We
              propose that the proportion of nearly identical isolates is more
              powerful at determining transmission dynamics than traditional
              estimators of genetic differentiation (F ST ) when gene flow
              between populations is high, since it is more responsive to
              recent transmission events. Our hypothesis was supported by the
              results from coalescent simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
              suggested that there was a high level of gene flow between
              hospitals facilitated by patient sharing, and that the proportion
              of nearly identical isolates is more sensitive to population
              structure than F ST when gene flow is high.",

              outbreaks involving three important pathogens:

              horizontal gene transfer, 16.2\% of isolate pairs considered

  abstract = "Horizontal DNA transfer (HDT) is a pervasive mechanism of
              diversification in many microbial species, but its primary
              evolutionary role remains controversial. Much recent research has
              emphasised the adaptive benefit of acquiring novel DNA, but here
              we argue instead that intragenomic conflict provides a coherent
              framework for understanding the evolutionary origins of HDT. To
              test this hypothesis, we developed a mathematical model of a
              clonally descended bacterial population undergoing HDT through
              transmission of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and genetic
              transformation. Including the known bias of transformation toward
              the acquisition of shorter alleles into the model suggested it
              could be an effective means of counteracting the spread of MGEs.
              Both constitutive and transient competence for transformation
              were found to provide an effective defence against parasitic
              MGEs; transient competence could also be effective at permitting
              the selective spread of MGEs conferring a benefit on their host
              bacterium. The coordination of transient competence with
              cell-cell killing, observed in multiple species, was found to
              result in synergistic blocking of MGE transmission through
              releasing genomic DNA for homologous recombination while
              simultaneously reducing horizontal MGE spread by lowering the
              local cell density. To evaluate the feasibility of the functions
              suggested by the modelling analysis, we analysed genomic data
              from longitudinal sampling of individuals carrying Streptococcus
              pneumoniae. This revealed the frequent within-host coexistence of
              clonally descended cells that differed in their MGE infection
              status, a necessary condition for the proposed mechanism to
              operate. Additionally, we found multiple examples of MGEs
              inhibiting transformation through integrative disruption of genes
              encoding the competence machinery across many species, providing
              evidence of an ongoing ``arms race.'' Reduced rates of
              transformation have also been observed in cells infected by MGEs
              that reduce the concentration of extracellular DNA through
              secretion of DNases. Simulations predicted that either mechanism
              of limiting transformation would benefit individual MGEs, but
              also that this tactic's effectiveness was limited by competition
              with other MGEs coinfecting the same cell. A further observed
              behaviour we hypothesised to reduce elimination by transformation
              was MGE activation when cells become competent. Our model
              predicted that this response was effective at counteracting
              transformation independently of competing MGEs. Therefore, this
              framework is able to explain both common properties of MGEs, and
              the seemingly paradoxical bacterial behaviours of transformation
              and cell-cell killing within clonally related populations, as the
              consequences of intragenomic conflict between self-replicating
              chromosomes and parasitic MGEs. The antagonistic nature of the
              different mechanisms of HDT over short timescales means their
              contribution to bacterial evolution is likely to be substantially
              greater than previously appreciated.",

              multiply drug-resistant hospital-associated methicillin-resistant
              Staphylococcus aureus (HA-MRSA). We performed whole-genome
              sequencing of representative HA-MRSA isolates of the ST239
              lineage from bacteremic patients in hospitals in Hong Kong (HK)
              and Beijing (BJ) and compared them with three published complete
              genomes of ST239, namely T0131, TW20 and JKD6008. Orthologous
              gene group (OGG) analyses of the Hong Kong and Beijing cluster
              strains were also undertaken. RESULTS: Homology analysis, based
              on highest-percentage nucleotide identity, indicated that HK
              isolates were closely related to TW20, whereas BJ isolates were
              more closely related to T0131 from Tianjin. Phylogenetic
              analysis, incorporating a total of 30 isolates from different
              continents, revealed that strains from HK clustered with TW20
              into the 'Asian clade', whereas BJ isolates and T0131 clustered
              closely with strains of the 'Turkish clade' from Eastern Europe.
              HK isolates contained the typical $\varphi$SP$\beta$-like
              prophage with the SasX gene similar to TW20. In contrast, BJ
              isolates contained a unique 15 kb PT1028-like prophage but lacked
              $\varphi$SP$\beta$-like and $\varphi$SA1 prophages. Besides
              distinct mobile genetic elements (MGE) in the two clusters, OGG
              analyses and whole-genome alignment of these clusters highlighted
              differences in genes located in the core genome, including the
              identification of single nucleotide deletions in several genes,
              resulting in frameshift mutations and the subsequent predicted
              truncation of encoded proteins involved in metabolism and
              antimicrobial resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Comparative genomics,
              based on de novo assembly and deep sequencing of HK and BJ
              strains, revealed different origins of the ST239 lineage in
              northern and southern China and identified differences between
              the two clades at single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), core gene
              and MGE levels. The results suggest that ST239 strains isolated
              in Hong Kong since the 1990s belong to the Asian clade, present
              mainly in southern Asia, whereas those that emerged in northern
              China were of a distinct origin, reflecting the complexity of
              dissemination and the dynamic evolution of this ST239 lineage.",

              nosocomial infection occurs in resource-restricted settings where
              barriers to transmission are lower. Here, we study the flux and
              genetic diversity of MRSA on ward and individual patient levels
              in a hospital where transmission was common. We repeatedly
              screened all patients on two intensive care units for MRSA
              carriage over a 3-mo period. All MRSA belonged to multilocus
              sequence type 239 (ST 239). We defined the population structure
              and charted the spread of MRSA by sequencing 79 isolates from 46
              patients and five members of staff, including the first
              MRSA-positive screen isolates and up to two repeat isolates where
              available. Phylogenetic analysis identified a flux of distinct ST
              239 clades over time in each intensive care unit. In total, five
              main clades were identified, which varied in the carriage of
              plasmids encoding antiseptic and antimicrobial resistance
              determinants. Sequence data confirmed intra- and interwards
              transmission events and identified individual patients who were
              colonized by more than one clade. One patient on each unit was
              the source of numerous transmission events, and deep sampling of
              one of these cases demonstrated colonization with a ``cloud'' of
              related MRSA variants. The application of whole-genome sequencing

               anti-staphylococcal agents. This study aims to characterize the
               genetic evolution to daptomycin resistance in S. aureus.
               METHODS: Whole genome sequencing was performed on a unique
               collection of isogenic, clinical (21 strains) and laboratory (12
               strains) derived strains that had been exposed to daptomycin and
               developed daptomycin-nonsusceptibility. Electron microscopy (EM)
               and lipid membrane studies were performed on selected isolates.
               RESULTS: On average, six coding region mutations were observed
               across the genome in the clinical daptomycin exposed strains,
               whereas only two mutations on average were seen in the
               laboratory exposed pairs. All daptomycin-nonsusceptible strains
               had a mutation in a phospholipid biosynthesis gene. This
               included mutations in the previously described mprF gene, but
               also in other phospholipid biosynthesis genes, including
               cardiolipin synthase (cls2) and
               CDP-diacylglycerol-glycerol-3-phosphate
               3-phosphatidyltransferase (pgsA). EM and lipid membrane
               composition analyses on two clinical pairs showed that the
               daptomycin-nonsusceptible strains had a thicker cell wall and an
               increase in membrane lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol. CONCLUSION:
               Point mutations in genes coding for membrane phospholipids are
               associated with the development of reduced susceptibility to
               daptomycin in S. aureus. Mutations in cls2 and pgsA appear to be
               new genetic mechanisms affecting daptomycin susceptibility in S.

              without known MRSA colonization. During the first 12-week cycle
              on a single unit, we sequenced 8 MRSA isolates per swab for 2
              body sites from each of 6 residents. During the second 12-week
              cycle, we sequenced 30 MRSA isolates from 13 residents with known
              MRSA colonization and 3 residents who had acquired MRSA
              colonization. RESULTS MRSA isolates from the same swab showed
              little genetic variation between isolates with the exception of
              isolates from wounds. The genetic variation of isolates between
              body sites on an individual was greater than that within a single
              body site with the exception of 1 sample, which had 2 unrelated
              strains among the 8 isolates. In the second cycle, 10 of 16
              residents colonized with MRSA (63\%) shared 1 of 3 closely
              related strains. Of the 3 residents with newly acquired MRSA, 2
              residents harbored isolates that were members of these clusters.
              CONCLUSIONS Point prevalence surveys with whole-genome sequencing
              of MRSA isolates may detect resident-to-resident transmission
              more accurately than routine surveillance cultures for MRSA in
              long-term care facilities. Infect. Control Hosp. Epidemiol.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infections range in
              severity due to expression of certain virulence factors encoded
              on mobile genetic elements (MGE). As such, characterization of
              these MGE, as well as single nucleotide polymorphisms, is of high
              clinical and microbiological importance. To understand the
              evolution of these dangerous pathogens, it is paramount to define
              reference strains that may predate MGE acquisition. One such
              candidate is S. aureus Tager 104, a previously uncharacterized
              strain isolated from a patient with impetigo in 1947. RESULTS: We
              show here that S. aureus Tager 104 can survive in the bloodstream
              and infect na{\"\i}ve organs. We also demonstrate a procedure to
              construct and validate the assembly of S. aureus genomes, using
              Tager 104 as a proof-of-concept. In so doing, we bridged
              confounding gap regions that limited our initial attempts to
              close this 2.82 Mb genome, through integration of data from
              Illumina Nextera paired-end, PacBio RS, and Lucigen NxSeq
              mate-pair libraries. Furthermore, we provide independent
              confirmation of our segmental arrangement of the Tager 104 genome
              by the sole use of Lucigen NxSeq libraries filled by paired-end
              MiSeq reads and alignment with SPAdes software. Genomic analysis
              of Tager 104 revealed limited MGE, and a $\nu$Sa$\beta$ island
              configuration that is reminiscent of other hospital acquired S.
              aureus genomes. CONCLUSIONS: Tager 104 represents an
              early-branching ancestor of certain hospital-acquired strains.
              Combined with its earlier isolation date and limited content of
              MGE, Tager 104 can serve as a viable reference for future
              comparative genome studies.",

              antibiotics are able to bind native PBP2a, the penicillin-binding

              broad class resistance to nearly all other beta-lactam

              of resistance to ceftaroline based on mecA mutations have been

              with the same thymidine insertion located 377 nucleotides

              ceftaroline-driven selections, we also isolated mutations to the
              same residue (Asn138) in PBP4. In addition, mutations in
              additional candidate genes such as ClpX endopeptidase, PP2C
              protein phosphatase and transcription terminator Rho, previously
              undescribed in the context of resistance to ceftaroline or
              ceftobiprole, were detected in multiple selections. These genomic
              findings suggest that non-mecA mechanisms, while yet to be

              bacterial species. It remains a leading cause of

              University experienced a putative outbreak of
              methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) that affected 12 patients
              in the Neurosurgery Department. In this study, whole-genome
              sequencing (WGS) was used to gain insight into the epidemiology
              of the outbreak caused by MRSA, and traditional bacterial
              genotyping approaches were also applied to provide supportive
              evidence for WGS. We sequenced the DNA from 6 isolates associated
              with the outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis was constructed by
              comparing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the core
              genome of 6 isolates in the present study and another 3
              referenced isolates from GenBank. Of the 6 MRSA sequences in the
              current study, 5 belonged to the same group, clustering with
              T0131, while the other one clustered closely with TW20. All of
              the isolates were identified as ST239-SCCmecIII clones.
              Whole-genome analysis revealed that four of the outbreak isolates
              were more tightly clustered into a group and SA13002 together
              with SA13009 were distinct from the outbreak strains, which were

              the antibiotic-resistance gene status (present or absent) was
              almost perfectly concordant with the results of phenotypic
              susceptibility testing. Various toxin genes were also analyzed
              successfully. Our analysis demonstrates that using traditional
              molecular methods and WGS can facilitate the identification of
              outbreaks and help to control nosocomial transmission.",

              isolates (n = 126) was tested for resistance to antibiotics
              commonly used to treat mastitis. Over half of the isolates (52\%)
              demonstrated resistance to penicillin and ampicillin but all were
              susceptible to the other antibiotics tested. S. aureus isolates
              were further examined for their clonal diversity by Multi-Locus
              Sequence Typing (MLST). In total, 18 different sequence types
              (STs) were identified and eBURST analysis demonstrated that the
              majority of isolates grouped into clonal complexes CC97, CC151 or
              sequence type (ST) 136. Analysis of the role of recombination
              events in determining S. aureus population structure determined
              that ST diversification through nucleotide substitutions were
              more likely to be due to recombination compared to point
              mutation, with regions of the genome possibly acting as
              recombination hotspots. DNA microarray analysis revealed a large

              genome content, including genes associated with capsule and
              biofilm formation and adhesion factors. Finally, evidence for a
              genomic arrangement was observed within isolates from CC97 with
              the ST71-like subgroup showing evidence of an IS431 insertion
              element having replaced approximately 30 kb of DNA including the
              ica operon and histidine biosynthesis genes, resulting in
              histidine auxotrophy. This genomic rearrangement may be

              overall spread of virulent lineages and to characterize
              outbreaks. To further elucidate the phylogeny of S. aureus, 35
              diverse strains were sequenced using whole genome sequencing. In
              addition, 29 publicly available whole genome sequences were
              included to create a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based
              phylogenetic tree encompassing 11 distinct lineages. All strains
              of a particular sequence type fell into the same clade with clear
              groupings of the major clonal complexes of CC8, CC5, CC30, CC45
              and CC1. Using a novel analysis method, we plotted the homoplasy
              density and SNP density across the whole genome and found
              evidence of recombination throughout the entire chromosome, but
              when we examined individual clonal lineages we found very little

              recombination between them. These data demonstrate that in S.
              aureus, recombination occurs across major lineages that
              subsequently expand in a clonal manner. Estimated mutation rates
              for the CC8 and CC5 lineages were different from each other.
              While the CC8 lineage rate was similar to previous studies, the
              CC5 lineage was 100-fold greater. Fifty known virulence genes
              were screened in all genomes in silico to determine their

              Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) epidemic in the United States is
              attributed to the spread of the USA300 clone. An epidemic of
              CA-MRSA closely related to USA300 has occurred in northern South
              America (USA300 Latin-American variant, USA300-LV). Using
              phylogenomic analysis, we aimed to understand the relationships
              between these 2 epidemics. METHODS: We sequenced the genomes of
              51 MRSA clinical isolates collected between 1999 and 2012 from
              the United States, Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador. Phylogenetic
              analysis was used to infer the relationships and times since the
              divergence of the major clades. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analyses
              revealed 2 dominant clades that segregated by geographical
              region, had a putative common ancestor in 1975, and originated in
              1989, in North America, and in 1985, in South America. Emergence
              of these parallel epidemics coincides with the independent
              acquisition of the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) in
              North American isolates and a novel copper and mercury resistance
              (COMER) mobile element in South American isolates. CONCLUSIONS:
              Our results reveal the existence of 2 parallel USA300 epidemics
              that shared a recent common ancestor. The simultaneous rapid
              dissemination of these 2 epidemic clades suggests the presence of
              shared, potentially convergent adaptations that enhance fitness

              resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. We examined by WGS a
              naturally occurring oxacillin-susceptible mecA-positive S. aureus
              isolate to identify the mechanism conferring oxacillin
              susceptibility. METHODS: The mecA-positive oxacillin-susceptible
              S. aureus isolate GR2 (penicillin and oxacillin MICs 0.094 and 1
              mg/L, respectively), belonging to clonal complex 80, was
              characterized. DNA fragment libraries were sequenced on Roche 454
              and Illumina MiSeq sequencers and de novo assembly of the genome
              was generated using SeqMan NGen software. Plasmid curing was
              conducted by SDS treatment. Expression of mecA was quantified
              without/with $\beta$-lactam pressure. RESULTS: The genome of GR2
              consisted of a 2 792 802 bp chromosome and plasmids pGR2A (28 895
              bp) and pGR2B (2473 bp). GR2 carried SCCmec type IV, with a
              truncated/non-functional mecR1 gene and no mecI. A single copy of
              the bla system, with an organization unique for S. aureus, was
              found, harboured by plasmid pGR2A. Particularly, the blaZ gene
              was orientated like its regulatory genes, blaI and blaR1, and a
              gene encoding transposase IS66 was integrated between blaZ and
              the regulatory genes deleting the 5'-end of blaR1; blaI, encoding
              blaZ/mecA repressor, was intact. After plasmid loss, GR2 became
              penicillin and oxacillin resistant (MICs 0.5 and 6 mg/L,
              respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We can conclude that after exposure
              to $\beta$-lactams, the non-functional BlaR1 does not cleave the
              mecA repressor BlaI, derepression does not occur and mecA is not
              efficiently expressed. Removal of the bla system after curing of
              pGR2A allows constitutive expression of mecA, resulting in
              oxacillin and penicillin resistance.",

              the same CC5 into phylogenetic- and virulence-associated
              genotypic subgroups by WGS and MA. A cohort of twelve blood
              stream and fifteen nasal MRSA isolates of CC5 (spa-types t003 and

              Clustering based on MA profiles was not concordant with WGS

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is
              a major cause of hospital-associated infection, but there is
              growing awareness of the emergence of multidrug-resistant
              lineages in community settings around the world. One such lineage
              is ST772-MRSA-V, which has disseminated globally and is
              increasingly prevalent in India. Here, we present the complete
              genome sequence of DAR4145, a strain of the ST772-MRSA-V lineage
              from India, and investigate its genomic characteristics in
              regards to antibiotic resistance and virulence factors. RESULTS:
              Sequencing using single-molecule real-time technology resulted in
              the assembly of a single continuous chromosomal sequence, which
              was error-corrected, annotated and compared to nine draft genome
              assemblies of ST772-MRSA-V from Australia, Malaysia and India. We
              discovered numerous and redundant resistance genes associated
              with mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and known core genome
              mutations that explain the highly antibiotic resistant phenotype
              of DAR4145. Staphylococcal toxins and superantigens, including
              the leukotoxin Panton-Valentinin Leukocidin, were predominantly
              associated with genomic islands and the phage
              $\varphi$-IND772PVL. Some of these mobile resistance and
              virulence factors were variably present in other strains of the
              ST772-MRSA-V lineage. CONCLUSIONS: The genomic characteristics
              presented here emphasize the contribution of MGEs to the
              emergence of multidrug-resistant and highly virulent strains of
              community-associated MRSA. Antibiotic resistance was further
              augmented by chromosomal mutations and redundancy of resistance
              genes. The complete genome of DAR4145 provides a valuable
              resource for future investigations into the global dissemination
              and phylogeography of ST772-MRSA-V.",

              to 144 SNPs differing between S0924 and strain S1800, an ST80
              MRSA from Greece. The gene content showed 21 regions of
              difference between the US and European isolates, although these
              were largely restricted to mobile genetic elements. Phylogenetic
              reconstruction indicated that the European strains were more
              closely related to each other than to the US strain. The SNP data
              suggest that a common ancestor existed around two decades ago,
              indicating that the US and European ST80 strains are clonally
              linked. CONCLUSIONS: These data combined with the country of
              origin of the patient suggest that ST80 S0924 was probably
              relatively recently introduced into the USA from Syria.",

              spaceflight. However, the molecular genetic changes of
              methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in response to
              the spaceflight environment have not been fully clarified. In the
              present study, we determined the draft genome sequences for an
              ancestral S. aureus strain (LCT-SAO) isolated from a clinical
              sample and three derivative strains, LCT-SAS, LCT-SAM and
              LCT-SAG, cultured in parallel during the spaceflight Shenzhou-X,
              under simulated microgravity and on the ground, respectively. To
              evaluate the impact of short-term spaceflight on the MRSA
              strains, comparative genomic analysis was implemented.
              Genome-based mapping of toxin genes and antibiotic resistance
              genes confirmed that these strains have the conventional
              pathogenicity and resistance to drugs, as none of the strains
              showed significant changes in these regions after culturing in
              the three different environments; this result suggests that
              spaceflight may not change bacterial virulence or drug
              resistance. Thirty-nine strain-specific sequence variants (SVs)
              were identified throughout the genomes, and the three derivatives
              exhibited almost the same mutation rates. Fifty-nine percent of
              SVs were located in the intergenic regions of the genomes,
              indicating that S. aureus may have an extremely robust repair
              mechanism responsible for recognizing and repairing DNA
              replication mismatches. It is noteworthy that strain LCT-SAS,
              cultured in space, presented the most unique SVs (n=9) and shared
              the fewest SVs with LCT-SAM (n=5) and LCT-SAG (n=4). Furthermore,
              we identified 10 potential deletion regions and 2 potential
              insertion regions, with LCT-SAS appearing more fragile than other
              strains by this measure. These results suggest that the
              environment of space is inherently complicated, with multiple
              variables, and cannot be simulated in a simple manner. Our
              results represent the first analysis of nucleotide structure
              variation of S. aureus strains in a spaceflight environment and
              also provide a valuable insight for understanding the mutation

              Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) was recognized in Europe and
              worldwide in the late 1990s. Within a decade, several genetically
              and geographically distinct CA-MRSA lineages carrying the small
              SCCmec type IV and V genetic elements and the Panton-Valentine
              leukocidin (PVL) emerged around the world. In Europe, the
              predominant CA-MRSA strain belongs to clonal complex 80 (CC80)
              and is resistant to kanamycin/amikacin and fusidic acid. CC80 was
              first reported in 1993 but was relatively rare until the late
              1990s. It has since been identified throughout North Africa, the
              Middle East, and Europe, with recent sporadic reports in
              sub-Saharan Africa. While strongly associated with skin and soft
              tissue infections, it is rarely found among asymptomatic
              carriers. Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) CC80 strains are
              extremely rare except in sub-Saharan Africa. In the current
              study, we applied whole-genome sequencing to a global collection
              of both MSSA and MRSA CC80 isolates. Phylogenetic analyses
              strongly suggest that the European epidemic CA-MRSA lineage is
              derived from a PVL-positive MSSA ancestor from sub-Saharan
              Africa. Moreover, the tree topology suggests a single acquisition
              of both the SCCmec element and a plasmid encoding the fusidic
              acid resistance determinant. Four canonical SNPs distinguish the
              derived CA-MRSA lineage and include a nonsynonymous mutation in
              accessory gene regulator C (agrC). These changes were associated
              with a star-like expansion into Europe, the Middle East, and
              North Africa in the early 1990s, including multiple cases of
              cross-continent imports likely driven by human migrations.
              IMPORTANCE: With increasing levels of CA-MRSA reported from most
              parts of the Western world, there is a great interest in
              understanding the origin and factors associated with the
              emergence of these epidemic lineages. To trace the origin,
              evolution, and dissemination pattern of the European CA-MRSA
              clone (CC80), we sequenced a global collection of strains of the
              S. aureus CC80 lineage. Our study determined that a single
              descendant of a PVL-positive methicillin-sensitive ancestor
              circulating in sub-Saharan Africa rose to become the dominant
              CA-MRSA clone in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. In
              the transition from a methicillin-susceptible lineage to a
              successful CA-MRSA clone, it simultaneously became resistant to
              fusidic acid, a widely used antibiotic for skin and soft tissue
              infections, thus demonstrating the importance of antibiotic
              selection in the success of this clone. This finding furthermore
              highlights the significance of horizontal gene acquisitions and
              underscores the combined importance of these factors for the
              success of CA-MRSA.",

              heterogeneity within this group hinders molecular investigations
              of related outbreaks. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) has
              been the gold standard approach but is impractical for many
              clinical laboratories and is often replaced with PCR-based
              methods. Regardless, both approaches can prove problematic for
              identifying subclonal outbreaks. Here, we explore the use of
              whole-genome sequencing for clinical laboratory investigations of
              MRSA molecular epidemiology. We examine the relationships of 44
              MRSA isolates collected over a period of 3 years by using
              whole-genome sequencing and two PCR-based methods, multilocus
              variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) and spa typing. We
              find that MLVA offers higher resolution than spa typing, as it
              resolved 17 versus 12 discrete isolate groups, respectively. In
              contrast, whole-genome sequencing reproducibly cataloged genomic
              variants (131,424 different single nucleotide polymorphisms and
              indels across the strain collection) that uniquely identified
              each MRSA clone, recapitulating those groups but enabling
              higher-resolution phylogenetic inferences of the epidemiological
              relationships. Importantly, whole-genome sequencing detected a
              significant number of variants, thereby distinguishing between
              groups that were considered identical by both spa typing
              (minimum, 1,124 polymorphisms) and MLVA (minimum, 193
              polymorphisms); this suggests that these more conventional
              approaches can lead to false-positive identification of outbreaks
              due to inappropriate grouping of genetically distinct strains. An
              analysis of the distribution of variants across the MRSA genome
              reveals 47 mutational hot spots (comprising ∼ 2.5\% of the
              genome) that account for 23.5\% of the observed polymorphisms,
              and the use of this selected data set successfully recapitulates

              established that the level of antibiotic resistance (i.e.,
              minimum concentration of a $\beta$-lactam antibiotic needed to
              inhibit growth) of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
              (MRSA) strain depends on the transcription and translation of the
              resistance protein PBP2A. Here we describe mutated loci in an
              additional novel set of genetic determinants that appear to be
              essential for the unusually high resistance levels typical of
              subpopulations of staphylococci that are produced with unique low
              frequency in most MRSA clinical isolates. We propose that
              mutations in these determinants can trigger induction of the
              stringent stress response which was recently shown to cause
              increased transcription/translation of the resistance protein
              PBP2A in parallel with the increased level of resistance.",

              hospital-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
              (HA-MRSA) are a major public health burden. The globally dominant
              sequence type 239 (ST239) HA-MRSA clone has persisted in the
              health care setting for decades, but the basis of its success has
              not been identified. Taking a collection of 123 ST239 isolates
              spanning 32 years, we have used population-based functional
              genomics to investigate the evolution of this highly persistent
              and successful clone. Phylogenetic reconstruction and population
              modeling uncovered a previously unrecognized distinct clade of
              ST239 that was introduced into Australia from Asia and has
              perpetuated the epidemic in this region. Functional analysis
              demonstrated attenuated virulence and enhanced resistance to
              last-line antimicrobials, the result of two different phenomena,
              adaptive evolution within the original Australian ST239 clade and
              the introduction of a new clade displaying shifts in both
              phenotypes. The genetic diversity between the clades allowed us
              to employ genome-wide association testing and identify mutations
              in other essential regulatory systems, including walKR, that
              significantly associate with and may explain these key
              phenotypes. The phenotypic convergence of two independently
              evolving ST239 clades highlights the very strong selective
              pressures acting on HA-MRSA, showing that hospital environments
              have favored the accumulation of mutations in essential MRSA
              genes that increase resistance to antimicrobials, attenuate
              virulence, and promote persistence in the health care
              environment. Combinations of comparative genomics and careful
              phenotypic measurements of longitudinal collections of clinical
              isolates are giving us the knowledge to intelligently address the
              impact of current and future antibiotic usage policies and
              practices on hospital pathogens globally. IMPORTANCE:
              Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is responsible
              for innumerable drug-resistant health care-associated infections
              globally. This study, the first to investigate the evolutionary
              response of hospital-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) over many decades,
              demonstrates how MRSA can persist in a region through the
              reintroduction of a previously unrecognized distinct clade. This
              study also demonstrates the crucial adaptive responses of HA-MRSA
              to the highly selective environment of the health care system,
              the evolution of MRSA isolates to even higher levels of
              antibiotic resistance at the cost of attenuated virulence.
              However, in vivo persistence is maintained, resulting in a clone
              of HA-MRSA able to resist almost all antimicrobial agents and
              still cause invasive disease in the heavily compromised hosts
              found in modern health care settings.",

              the Indian subcontinent. It is found increasingly common in other
              areas of the world. METHODS: One isolate of ST772-MRSA-V was
              sequenced using the Illumina Genome Analyzer System. After
              initial assembling the multiple sequence contigs were analysed
              using different in-house annotation scripts. Results were
              compared to microarray hybridisation results of clinical isolates
              of ST772-MRSA-V, of related strains and to another ST772-MRSA-V
              genome sequence. RESULTS: According to MLST e-burst analysis,
              ST772-MRSA-V belongs to Clonal Complex (CC)1, differing from ST1
              only in one MLST allele (pta-22). However, there are several
              additional differences including agr alleles (group II rather

              sequence variants compared with the reference strain 8325

              chemical mutagenesis of the restriction-defective RN4220. Using

              contains 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) arising prior
              to the construction of RN4220. We identified 5 indels in 8325-4

              intergenic region is common to only a sub-lineage of 8325-4

              transcript levels in post-exponential phase. The sub-lineage
              8325-4 was also found to harbor 4 additional SNPs. We also found
              large sequence variation between 8325, 8325-4 and RN4220 in a
              cluster of repetitive hypothetical proteins (SA0282 homologs)

              determinant implicated in neutrophil chemotaxis, biofilm

              MRSA isolates from children with osteomyelitis who have diverse
              severity of illness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children with
              osteomyelitis were prospectively studied between 2010 and 2011.
              Severity of illness of the affected children was determined from
              clinical and laboratory parameters. MRSA isolates were analyzed
              with next generation sequencing (NGS) and optical mapping.
              Sequence data was used for multi-locus sequence typing (MLST),
              phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood (PAML), and
              identification of virulence genes and single nucleotide
              polymorphisms (SNP) relative to reference strains. RESULTS: The
              twelve children studied demonstrated severity of illness scores
              ranging from 0 (mild) to 9 (severe). All isolates were USA300, ST
              8, SCC mec IVa MRSA by MLST. The isolates differed from reference
              strains by 2 insertions (40 Kb each) and 2 deletions (10 and 25
              Kb) but had no rearrangements or copy number variations. There
              was a higher occurrence of virulence genes among study isolates
              when compared to the reference strains (p = 0.0124). There were
              an average of 11 nonsynonymous SNPs per strain. PAML demonstrated
              heterogeneity of study isolates from each other and from the

              MRSA isolates causing osteomyelitis among children in a single

              studies have utilized mutant screens to identify loci that

              concerning the genomic changes which accompany experimental
              evolution of AMP resistance. Using genome re-sequencing we

              of resistance to the cationic AMPs iseganan, melittin and
              pexiganan, as well as to a combination of melittin and pexiganan,

              This includes genes previously identified from mutant screens for

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: We previously reported the case of a 64-year-old man
              with mediastinitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus in which the
              infecting bacterium acquired linezolid resistance after only 14
              days treatment with linezolid. We therefore investigated relevant
              clinical isolates for possible mechanisms of this rapid
              acquisition of linezolid resistance. METHODS: Using clinical S.
              aureus isolates, we assessed the in vitro mutation rate and
              performed stepwise selection for linezolid resistance. To
              investigate homologous recombination, sequences were determined
              for each of the 23S ribosomal RNA (23S rRNA) loci; analyzed
              sequences spanned the entirety of each 23S rRNA gene, including
              domain V, as well as the 16S-23S intergenic spacer regions. We
              additionally performed next-generation sequencing on clinical
              strains to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms compared to
              the N315 genome. RESULTS: Strains isolated from the patient prior
              to linezolid exposure (M5-M7) showed higher-level linezolid
              resistance than N315, and the pre-exposure strain (M2) exhibited
              more rapid acquisition of linezolid resistance than did N315.
              However, the mutation rates of these and contemporaneous clinical
              isolates were similar to those of N315, and the isolates did not
              exhibit any mutations in hypermutation-related genes. Sequences
              of the 23S rRNA genes and 16S-23S intergenic spacer regions were
              identical among the pre- and post-exposure clinical strains.
              Notably, all of the pre-exposure isolates harbored a recQ
              missense mutation (Glu69Asp) with respect to N315; such a lesion
              may have affected short sequence recombination (facilitating, for
              example, recombination among rrn loci). We hypothesize that this
              mechanism contributed to rapid acquisition of linezolid
              resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Hypermutation and homologous
              recombination of the ribosomal RNA genes, including 23S rRNA
              genes, appear not to have been sources of the accelerated
              acquisition of linezolid resistance observed in our clinical
              case. Increased frequency of short sequence recombination may
              have resulted from a recQ variant in the infecting organism.",

              clones of bacteria is limited. ST59 is a major epidemic clone of
              community-associated MRSA in East Asia, responsible for extensive
              morbidity and mortality, but has a much lower prevalence in other
              parts of the world. The geographic origin of ST59 and its
              international routes of dissemination are unclear and disputed in
              the literature. RESULTS: To investigate the origin and spread of
              the ST59 clone, we obtained whole genome sequences of isolates
              from four continents, sampled over more than a decade, and
              carried out a time-scaled phylogeographic analysis. We discover
              that two distinct ST59 clades emerged concurrently, in East Asia
              and the USA, but underwent clonal expansion at different times.
              The East Asia clade was strongly enriched for gene determinants
              associated with antibiotic resistance, consistent with regional
              differences in antibiotic usage. Both clones spread independently
              to Australia and Europe, and we found evidence of the persistence
              of multi-drug resistance following export from East Asia. Direct
              transfer of strains between Taiwan and the USA was not observed
              in either direction, consistent with geographic niche exclusion.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our results resolve a longstanding controversy
              regarding the origin of the ST59 clone, revealing the major
              global source and sink populations and routes for the spread of
              multi-drug resistant clones. Additionally, our findings indicate
              that diversification of the accessory genome of epidemic clones

              ecological niches, host types, and antibiotic resistance
              profiles. Based on this set, S. aureus is expected to have an
              open pangenome composed of 7,411 genes and a core genome composed
              of 1,441 genes. Metabolism was highly conserved in this core
              genome; however, differences were identified in amino acid and
              nucleotide biosynthesis pathways between the strains.
              Genome-scale models (GEMs) of metabolism were constructed for the
              64 strains of S. aureus These GEMs enabled a systems approach to
              characterizing the core metabolic and panmetabolic capabilities

              can thus be used to identify metabolic determinants of virulence

              patients infected by PVL-producing strains were investigated.
              RESULTS: This work reports 15 cases of infections due to
              PVL-producing strains affecting mostly asylum seekers (n=10),
              people working with refugees and/or exposed to Africans (n=3).
              Most infections were due to closely related strains of CC152

              Epidemiological link between the 15 cases could be ruled out by
              WGS (33 to 172 core SNPs between the different strains of a given

              genes are widespread in bacterial pathogens, but it has remained
              unclear how they occasionally jump to new host species.
              Staphylococcus aureus clones exchange MGEs such as S. aureus
              pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) with high frequency via helper

              USA300 is the leading cause of MRSA infections in the United
              States and has caused an epidemic of skin and soft-tissue
              infections. Recurrent infections with USA300 MRSA are common, yet
              intrahost evolution during persistence on an individual has not
              been studied. This gap hinders the ability to clinically manage
              recurrent infections and reconstruct transmission networks.
              METHODS: To characterize bacterial intrahost evolution, we
              examined the clinical courses of 4 subjects with 3-6 recurrent
              USA300 MRSA infections, using patient clinical data, including
              antibiotic exposure history, and whole-genome sequencing and
              phylogenetic analysis of all available MRSA isolates (n = 29).
              RESULTS: Among sequential isolates, we found variability in
              diversity, accumulation of mutations, and mobile genetic
              elements. Selection for antimicrobial-resistant populations was
              observed through both an increase in the number of plasmids
              conferring multidrug resistance and strain replacement by a
              resistant population. Two of 4 subjects had strain replacement
              with a genetically distinct USA300 MRSA population. DISCUSSIONS:
              During a 5-year period in 4 subjects, we identified development
              of antimicrobial resistance, intrahost evolution, and strain
              replacement among isolates from patients with recurrent MRSA
              infections. This calls into question the efficacy of
              decolonization to prevent recurrent infections and highlights the
              adaptive potential of USA300 and the need for effective sampling.",

              multiple anthroponotic transmissions of S. aureus from humans to
              green monkeys, Chlorocebus sabaeus in The Gambia over different
              timescales. We report a novel monkey-associated clade of S.
              aureus that emerged from a human-to-monkey switch estimated to
              have occurred 2,700 years ago. Adaptation of this lineage to the
              monkey host is accompanied by loss of phage-encoded genes that
              are known to play an important role in human colonisation. We
              also report recent anthroponotic transmission of the
              well-characterised human lineages, ST6 and ST15, to monkeys,
              probably because of steadily increasing encroachment of humans

              transmission of S. aureus from monkeys to humans, as the two

              risk of additional inter-species exchanges of potential
              pathogens. IMPORTANCE: The population structures of
              Staphylococcus aureus in humans and monkeys in sub-Saharan Africa
              have been previously described using MLST. However, these data
              lack the power to accurately infer details regarding the origin
              and maintenance of new adaptive lineages. Here, we describe the
              use of whole genome sequencing to detect transmission of S.
              aureus between humans and non-human primates and to document the
              genetic changes accompanying host adaptation. We note that human
              to monkey switches tend to be more common than the reverse, and
              that a novel monkey associated clade is likely to have emerged
              from such a switch approximately 2700 years ago. Moreover,
              analysis of the accessory genome provides important clues as to
              the genetic changes underpinning host adaptation, and in
              particular show that human to monkey switches tend to be

              SCCmec type XII was identified in the two MRSA isolates, which
              included a rare class C2 mec gene complex. A 24kb $\Psi$SCC
              fragment was found in the MRSA and MSSA isolates sharing 99\%

              element of a ST9 MRSA isolate from Thailand (accession number

              high-level mupirocin resistance (HMR) have been identified. The
              aim of this study was to determine the epidemiology of LMR and
              HMR in MRSA isolates at five hospitals that have used mupirocin
              for targeted decolonization as part of successful institutional
              control programmes. METHODS: All MRSA identified in three
              microbiology laboratories serving five central and south-east
              London hospitals and surrounding communities between November
              2011 and February 2012 were included. HMR and LMR were determined
              by disc diffusion testing. WGS was used to derive multilocus
              sequence types (MLSTs) and the presence of HMR and LMR resistance
              determinants. RESULTS: Prevalence of either HMR or LMR amongst
              first healthcare episode isolates from 795 identified patients
              was 9.69\% (95\% CI 7.72-11.96); LMR was 6.29\% (95\% CI
              4.70-8.21) and HMR was 3.40\% (95\% CI 2.25-4.90). Mupirocin
              resistance was not significantly different in isolates identified
              from inpatients at each microbiology laboratory, but was more
              common in genotypically defined 'hospital' rather than
              'community' isolates (OR 3.17, 95\% CI 1.36-9.30, P = 0.002). LMR
              was associated with inpatient stay, previous history of MRSA and
              age $\geq$65 years; HMR was associated with age $\geq$65 years
              and residential postcode outside London. LMR and HMR varied by
              clone, with both being low in the dominant UK MRSA clone ST22
              compared with ST8, ST36 and ST239/241 for LMR and with ST8 and
              ST36 for HMR. V588F mutation and mupA carriage had high
              specificity (>97\%) and area under the curve (>83\%) to
              discriminate phenotypic mupirocin resistance, but uncertainty
              around the sensitivity point estimate was large (95\% CI
              52.50\%-94.44\%). Mutations in or near the mupA gene were found
              in eight isolates that carried mupA but were not HMR.
              CONCLUSIONS: Mupirocin resistance was identified in <10\% of
              patients and varied significantly by clone, implying that changes
              in clonal epidemiology may have an important role in determining

              vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, MDR Escherichia coli,

              Muenster, Muenster, Germany, a tertiary care hospital with 1,450
              beds, during two 6-month intervals. Turnaround times (TAT) were
              measured, and total costs for sequencing per isolate were
              calculated. After cancelling prior policies of preemptive
              isolation of patients harboring certain Gram-negative MDR
              bacteria in risk areas, the second interval was conducted. During
              interval I, 645 bacterial isolates were sequenced. From culture,
              TATs ranged from 4.4 to 5.3 days, and costs were €202.49 per
              isolate. During interval II, 550 bacterial isolates were
              sequenced. Hospital-wide transmission rates of the two most
              common species (MRSA and MDR E. coli) were low during interval I
              (5.8\% and 2.3\%, respectively) and interval II (4.3\% and 5.0\%,

              with non-pan-resistant MDR E. coli in risk wards did not increase
              transmission. Comparing sequencing costs with avoided costs
              mostly due to fewer blocked beds during interval II, we saved in
              excess of €200,000. Real-time microbial WGS in our institution
              was feasible, produced precise actionable results, helped us to

              (MRSA), control of which may reduce MRSA transmission and

              sequencing (WGS) has been used successfully to understand MRSA
              epidemiology and transmission in hospitals and has the potential
              to identify transmission between these and LTCF. METHODS: Two
              prospective observational studies of MRSA carriage were conducted
              in LTCF in England and Ireland. MRSA isolates were whole-genome
              sequenced and analyzed using established methods. Genomic data
              were available for MRSA isolated in the local healthcare systems
              (isolates submitted by hospitals and general practitioners).
              RESULTS: We sequenced a total of 181 MRSA isolates from the two
              study sites. The majority of MRSA were multilocus sequence type
              (ST)22. WGS identified one likely transmission event between
              residents in the English LTCF and three putative transmission
              events in the Irish LTCF. WGS also identified closely related
              isolates present in colonized Irish residents and their immediate
              environment. Based on phylogenetic reconstruction, closely
              related MRSA clades were identified between the LTCF and their
              healthcare referral network, together with putative MRSA
              acquisition by LTCF residents during hospital admission.
              CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm that MRSA is transmitted between
              residents of LTCF and is both acquired and transmitted to others
              in referral hospitals and beyond. Our data present compelling
              evidence for the importance of environmental contamination in

              factors for human carriage and study transmission between animals
              and humans. METHODS: On 10 duck and 10 turkey farms, samples were
              taken from animals, poultry houses, home residences and humans
              and cultured using pre-enrichment and selective enrichment. MRSA
              isolates were typed by spa typing and multiple-locus variable
              number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) typing. A subset of isolates
              from animals and humans was investigated using whole-genome
              mapping. RESULTS: MRSA was found on one duck farm and three
              turkey farms. On duck farms, all humans were MRSA negative. On
              turkey farms, 5 of 11 farmers, 2 of 32 family members and 15 of
              49 samples from the home residences were MRSA positive.
              Individuals with daily contact with turkeys were significantly
              more often MRSA positive than individuals without daily contact.
              All MRSA isolates belonged to livestock-associated MLVA complex
              398, belonged to spa type t011, were negative for
              Panton-Valentine leucocidin, were mecC negative and were mecA
              positive. Whole-genome mapping proved a valuable tool to study
              the transmission of livestock-associated MRSA and showed that on
              two turkey farms the isolates from the animals and humans were
              indistinguishable or closely related, indicating transmission.
              CONCLUSIONS: MRSA carriage in individuals in daily contact with
              turkeys was significantly higher than that in individuals only
              living on the farms or than in the general Dutch population.
              Therefore, persons with a high degree of contact with turkeys
              have an increased risk of MRSA carriage, and we propose that they
              should be screened prior to hospitalization in order to decrease

              healthcare-associated (HA) and community-associated (CA) MRSA
              remain poorly understood and may vary by genotype, hindering the
              development of effective prevention and control strategies. From
              2008-2010, all patients admitted to a level III NICU were
              screened for MRSA colonization, and all available isolates were
              spa-typed. Spa-type t008, the most prevalent CA- genotype in the
              United States, spa-type t045, a HA- related genotype, and a
              convenience sample of strains isolated from 2003-2011, underwent
              whole-genome sequencing and phylodynamic analysis. Patient risk
              factors were compared between colonized and noncolonized infants,
              and virulence and resistance genes compared between spa-type t008
              and non-t008 strains. Epidemiological and genomic data were used
              to estimate MRSA importations and acquisitions through
              transmission reconstruction. MRSA colonization was identified in
              9.1\% (177/1940) of hospitalized infants and associated with low
              gestational age and birth weight. Among colonized infants, low
              gestational age was more common among those colonized with t008
              strains. Our data suggest that approximately 70\% of
              colonizations were the result of transmission events within the
              NICU, with the remainder likely to reflect importations of
              ``outside'' strains. While risk of transmission within the NICU
              was not affected by spa-type, patterns of acquisition and
              importation differed between t008 and t045 strains. Phylodynamic
              analysis showed the effective population size of spa-type t008
              has been exponentially increasing in both community and hospital,
              with spa-type t008 strains possessed virulence genes not found
              among t045 strains; t045 strains, in contrast, appeared to be of
              more recent origin, with a possible hospital source. Our data
              highlight the importance of both intra-NICU transmission and
              recurrent introductions in maintenance of MRSA colonization
              within the NICU environment, as well as spa-type-specific
              differences in epidemiology.",

              Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has been a common threat, with

              geographical structure of ST8/SCCmecIV has not yet been fully
              elucidated. We herein determined the complete circular genome
              sequence of ST8/SCCmecIVc strain OC8 from Siberian Russia. We
              found that 36.0\% of the genome was inverted relative to USA300.
              Two IS256, oppositely oriented, at IS256-enriched hot spots were
              implicated with the one-megabase genomic inversion (MbIN) and
              vSa$\beta$ split. The behavior of IS256 was flexible: its
              insertion site (att) sequences on the genome and junction
              sequences of extrachromosomal circular DNA were all divergent,
              albeit with fixed sizes. A similar multi-IS256 system was
              detected, even in prevalent ST239 healthcare-associated MRSA in
              Russia, suggesting IS256's strong transmission potential and
              advantage in evolution. Regarding epidemiology, all ST8/SCCmecIVc
              strains from European, Siberian, and Far Eastern Russia, examined
              had MbIN, and geographical expansion accompanied divergent spa
              types and resistance to fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol, and
              often rifampicin. Russia ST8/SCCmecIVc has been associated with
              life-threatening infections such as pneumonia and sepsis in both
              community and hospital settings. Regarding virulence, the OC8
              genome carried a series of toxin and immune evasion genes, a
              truncated giant surface protein gene, and IS256 insertion
              adjacent to a pan-regulatory gene. These results suggest that
              unique single ST8/spa1(t008)/SCCmecIVc CA-MRSA (clade, Russia
              ST8-IVc) emerged in Russia, and this was followed by large
              geographical expansion, with MbIN as an epidemiological marker,
              and fluoroquinolone resistance, multiple virulence factors, and
              possibly a multi-IS256 system as selective advantages.",

              commensal bacterium may cause diseases in humans and other
              animals. In this study, we present the first report of whole
              genome sequencing of S. xylosus strain DMB3-Bh1, which was
              isolated from the stool of a mouse. RESULTS: The draft genome of
              S. xylosus strain DMB3-Bh1 consisted of 2,81,0255 bp with G+C
              content of 32.7 mol\%, 2623 predicted coding sequences (CDSs) and
              58 RNAs. The final assembly contained 12 contigs of total size
              2,81,0255 bp with N50 contig length of 4,37,962 bp and the
              largest contig assembled measured 7,61,338 bp. Further, an
              interspecies comparative genomic analysis through rapid
              annotation using subsystem technology server was achieved with
              Staphylococcus aureus RF122 that revealed 36 genes having
              similarity with S. xylosus DMB3-Bh1. 35 genes encoded for
              virulence, disease and defense and 1 gene encoded for phages,
              prophages and transposable elements. CONCLUSIONS: These results
              suggest co linearity in genes between S. xylosus DMB3-Bh1 and S.
              aureus RF122 that contribute to pathogenicity and might be the
              result of horizontal gene transfer. The study indicates that S.

              Vancomycin-survivor strains, which appeared after 96 h of

              Although the vancomycin minimum-inhibitory concentrations (MICs)
              with the survivor strains were within the susceptible range, the
              cytokilling effects of vancomycin at 20-fold MIC were
              significantly lower than those in the parent strain. Whole-genome

              acting via inhibition of the function of IleRS.",

              LA-MRSA CC398 isolates collected after screening more than a
              thousand S. aureus animal isolates from the UK between 2013 and

              compared. Phylogenetic reconstruction applied to WGS data to
              assess genetic relatedness of all 89 isolates, clustered the 12
              UK CC398 LA-MRSA within the European sub-lineages, although on

              the UK, as opposed to a single introduction followed by clonal
              expansion. Three UK isolates from healthy pigs and one from
              turkey clustered within the cassette chromosome recombinases ccr
              C S. aureus protein A (spa)-type t011 European sub-lineage and
              three UK isolates from horses within the ccrA2B2 t011 European
              sub-lineage. The remaining UK isolates, mostly from pigs,
              clustered within the t034 European lineage. Presence of
              virulence, antimicrobial (AMR), heavy metal (HMR), and
              disinfectant (DR) resistance genes were determined using an
              in-house pipeline. Most, including UK isolates, harbored
              resistance genes to $\geq$3 antimicrobial classes in addition to
              $\beta$-lactams. HMR genes were detected in most European ccrC
              positive isolates, with >80\% harboring czrC, encoding zinc and
              cadmium resistance; in contrast ~60\% ccrC isolates within
              non-European lineages and 6\% ccrA2B2 isolates showed this
              characteristic. The UK turkey MRSA isolate did not harbor
              $\varphi$AV$\beta$ avian prophage genes (SAAV\_2008 and
              SAAV\_2009) present in US MSSA isolates from turkey and pigs.

              virulence genes in the UK LA-MRSA animal isolates was not

              isolates collected in the past 2 years most likely represent
              separate incursions into the UK from other European countries.
              The presence of zinc and cadmium resistance in all nine food
              animal isolates (pig and poultry), which was absent from the 3

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Community acquired (CA) methicillin-resistant
              Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) increasingly causes disease
              worldwide. USA300 has emerged as the predominant clone causing
              superficial and invasive infections in children and adults in the
              USA. Epidemiological studies suggest that USA300 is more virulent
              than other CA-MRSA. The genetic determinants that render
              virulence and dominance to USA300 remain unclear. RESULTS: We
              sequenced the genomes of two pediatric USA300 isolates: one
              CA-MRSA and one CA-methicillin susceptible (MSSA), isolated at
              Texas Children's Hospital in Houston. DNA sequencing was
              performed by Sanger dideoxy whole genome shotgun (WGS) and 454
              Life Sciences pyrosequencing strategies. The sequence of the
              USA300 MRSA strain was rigorously annotated. In USA300-MRSA 2658
              chromosomal open reading frames were predicted and 3.1 and 27
              kilobase (kb) plasmids were identified. USA300-MSSA contained a
              20 kb plasmid with some homology to the 27 kb plasmid found in
              USA300-MRSA. Two regions found in US300-MRSA were absent in
              USA300-MSSA. One of these carried the arginine deiminase operon
              that appears to have been acquired from S. epidermidis. The
              USA300 sequence was aligned with other sequenced S. aureus
              genomes and regions unique to USA300 MRSA were identified.
              CONCLUSION: USA300-MRSA is highly similar to other MRSA strains
              based on whole genome alignments and gene content, indicating
              that the differences in pathogenesis are due to subtle changes
              rather than to large-scale acquisition of virulence factor genes.
              The USA300 Houston isolate differs from another sequenced USA300
              strain isolate, derived from a patient in San Francisco, in
              plasmid content and a number of sequence polymorphisms. Such

              information.Here, we newly sequenced 846 clinical gram-negative
              bacterial isolates representing multiple distinct genera and
              compared the performance of five tools (CLARK, Kaiju, Kraken,
              DIAMOND/MEGAN and TUIT). To establish a faithful 'gold standard',
              the expert-driven taxonomy was compared with identifications
              based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
              time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) analysis.
              Additionally, the tools were also evaluated using a data set of
              200 Staphylococcus aureus isolates.CLARK and Kraken (with k =31)
              performed best with 626 (100\%) and 193 (99.5\%) correct species
              classifications for the gram-negative and S aureus isolates,
              respectively. Moreover, CLARK and Kraken demonstrated highest
              mean F-measure values (85.5/87.9\% and 94.4/94.7\% for the two
              data sets, respectively) in comparison with DIAMOND/MEGAN (71 and
              85.3\%), Kaiju (41.8 and 18.9\%) and TUIT (34.5 and 86.5\%).
              Finally, CLARK, Kaiju and Kraken outperformed the other tools by
              a factor of 30 to 170 fold in terms of runtime.We conclude that
              the application of nucleotide-based tools using k-mers-e.g. CLARK
              or Kraken-allows for accurate and fast taxonomic characterization
              of bacterial isolates from WGS data. Hence, our results suggest
              WGS-based genotyping to be a promising alternative to the
              MS-based biotyping in clinical settings. Moreover, we suggest
              that complementary information should be used for the evaluation
              of taxonomic classification tools, as public databases may suffer

              strains have spread globally. We previously isolated an ST239
              VISA (XN108) with a vancomycin MIC of 12 mg/L. The mechanism for
              XN108 resistance to vancomycin was investigated in this study.
              METHODS: Genome comparison was performed to characterize
              mutations that might contribute to the XN108 resistance
              phenotype. The novel mutation WalK(S221P) was identified and
              investigated using allelic replacement experiments. Vancomycin
              susceptibilities, autolytic activities and morphologies of the
              strains were examined. Autophosphorylation activities of WalK and
              the WalK(S221P) mutant were determined in vitro with
              [$\lambda$-(32)P]ATP, and binding activity of
              WalK(S221P)-activated WalR to the promoter region of its target
              gene lytM was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay.
              RESULTS: Genome comparison revealed three mutations, GraS(T136I),
              RpoB(H481N) and WalK(S221P), which might be responsible for
              vancomycin resistance in XN108. The introduction of WalK(S221P)
              to the vancomycin-susceptible strain N315 increased its
              vancomycin MIC from 1.5 to 8 mg/L, whereas the allelic
              replacement of WalK(S221P) with the native N315 WalK allele in
              XN108 decreased its vancomycin MIC from 12 to 4 mg/L. The VISA
              strains have thickened cell walls and decreased autolysis,
              consistent with observed changes in the expression of genes
              involved in cell wall metabolism and virulence regulation.
              WalK(S221P) exhibited reduced autophosphorylation, which may lead
              to reduced phosphorylation of WalR. WalK(S221P)-phosphorylated
              WalR also exhibited a reduced capacity to bind to the lytM

              an Illumina Miseq sequencer. Run acceptance criteria were
              sequencing outputs > 5.6 Gb and Q30 read quality scores > 75\%.
              Subsequently, spa typing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST),
              ribosomal MLST, and core genome (cg)MLST were performed by the

              of the bacteriocin produced by the pETB-positive strain TY4 was

              activity against all pETB-negative but not pETB-positive strains,

              aureus (CA-MRSA) strain known as pulsed-field type USA300
              (USA300) is epidemic in the United States. Previous comparative
              whole-genome sequencing studies demonstrated that there has been
              recent clonal emergence of a subset of USA300 isolates, which
              comprise the epidemic clone. Although the core genomes of these
              isolates are closely related, the level of diversity among USA300

              contribute to significant gene diversity among otherwise closely
              related USA300 isolates, we performed de novo sequencing of
              endogenous plasmids from 10 previously characterized USA300
              clinical isolates obtained from different geographic locations in
              the United States. All isolates tested contained small (2- to
              3-kb) and/or large (27- to 30-kb) plasmids. The large plasmids
              encoded heavy metal and/or antimicrobial resistance elements,
              including those that confer resistance to cadmium, bacitracin,
              macrolides, penicillin, kanamycin, and streptothricin, although
              all isolates were sensitive to minocycline, doxycycline,
              trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and
              linezolid. One of the USA300 isolates contained an archaic
              plasmid that encoded staphylococcal enterotoxins R, J, and P.
              Notably, the large plasmids (27 to 28 kb) from 8 USA300
              isolates--those that comprise the epidemic USA300 clone--were
              virtually identical (99\% identity) and similar to a large
              plasmid from strain USA300\_TCH1516 (a previously sequenced
              USA300 strain from Houston, TX). These plasmids are largely
              divergent from the 37-kb plasmid of FPR3757, the first sequenced
              USA300 strain. The high level of plasmid sequence identity among
              the majority of closely related USA300 isolates is consistent
              with the recent clonal emergence hypothesis for USA300.",

              ability to treat bacterial infections. While acquired resistance
              has received considerable attention, relatively little is known
              of intrinsic resistance that allows bacteria to naturally
              withstand antimicrobials. Gene products that confer intrinsic
              resistance to antimicrobial agents may be explored for
              alternative antimicrobial therapies, by potentiating the efficacy
              of existing antimicrobials. In this study, we identified the
              intrinsic resistome to a broad spectrum of antimicrobials in the
              human pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus. We screened the Nebraska
              Transposon Mutant Library of 1920 single-gene inactivations in S.
              aureus strain JE2, for increased susceptibility to the
              anti-staphylococcal antimicrobials (ciprofloxacin, oxacillin,
              linezolid, fosfomycin, daptomycin, mupirocin, vancomycin, and
              gentamicin). Sixty-eight mutants were confirmed by E-test to
              display at least twofold increased susceptibility to one or more
              antimicrobial agents. The majority of the identified genes have
              not previously been associated with antimicrobial susceptibility
              in S. aureus. For example, inactivation of genes encoding for
              subunits of the ATP synthase, atpA, atpB, atpG and atpH, reduced
              the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of gentamicin 16-fold.
              To elucidate the potential of the screen, we examined treatment
              efficacy in the Galleria mellonella infection model. Gentamicin
              efficacy was significantly improved, when treating larvae
              infected with the atpA mutant compared to wild type cells with
              gentamicin at a clinically relevant concentration. Our results
              demonstrate that many gene products contribute to the intrinsic
              antimicrobial resistance of S. aureus. Knowledge of these
              intrinsic resistance determinants provides alternative targets

              major pathogens causing mastitis in dairy ruminants worldwide.
              The chronic nature of Staph. aureus infection enhances the
              contagiousness risk and diffusion in herds. In order to identify
              the factors involved in intra-mammary infection (IMI) and
              diffusion in dairy cows, we investigated the molecular
              characteristics of two groups of Staph. aureus strains belonging
              to ST8 and ST398, differing in clinical properties, through
              comparison of whole genome and whole transcriptome sequencing.
              RESULTS: The two groups of strains, one originated from high IMI
              prevalence herds and the other from low IMI prevalence herds,
              present a peculiar set of genes and polymorphisms related to
              phenotypic features, such as bacterial invasion of mammary
              epithelial cells and host adaptation. Transcriptomic analysis
              supports the high propensity of ST8 strain to chronicity of
              infection and to a higher potential cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS:
              Our data are consistent with the invasiveness and host adaptation
              feature for the strains GTB/ST8 associated to high within-herd

              homologue mecC, but little is known about the evolutionary
              dynamics involved in gain and loss of resistance. The objective
              of this study was to obtain an expanded understanding of
              Staphylococcus aureus methicillin resistance microevolution in
              vivo, by focusing on a single lineage. METHODS: We compared the
              whole-genome sequences of 231 isolates from a single epidemic
              lineage [clonal complex 30 (CC30) and spa-type t018] of S. aureus
              that caused an epidemic in the UK. RESULTS: We show that
              resistance to methicillin in this single lineage was gained on at
              least two separate occasions, one of which led to a clonal
              expansion around 1995 presumably caused by a selective advantage.
              Resistance was, however, subsequently lost in vivo by nine
              strains isolated between 2008 and 2012. We describe the genetic
              mechanisms involved in this loss of resistance and the imperfect
              relationship between genotypic and phenotypic resistance.
              CONCLUSIONS: The recent re-emergence of methicillin
              susceptibility in this epidemic lineage suggests a significant
              fitness cost of resistance and reduced selective advantage

              applied comparative whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analyses to
              epidemiologically and geographically diverse ST398-MSSA, a
              pandemic lineage affecting both humans and livestock. Bayesian
              phylogenetic analysis predicted divergence of human-associated
              ST398-MSSA ~40 years ago. Isolates from Midwestern pigs and
              veterinarians differed substantially from those in New York City
              (NYC). Pig ST398 strains contained a large region of
              recombination representing imports from multiple sequence types
              (STs). Phylogeographic analyses supported the spread of
              ST398-MSSA along local cultural and migratory links between parts
              of the Caribbean, North America, and France, respectively.
              Applying pairwise single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distances
              as a measure of genetic relatedness between isolates, we observed
              that ST398 not only clustered in households but also frequently
              extended across local social networks. Isolates collected from
              environmental surfaces reflected the full diversity of colonizing
              individuals, highlighting their potentially critical role as
              reservoirs for transmission and diversification. Strikingly, we
              observed high within-host SNP variability compared to our
              previous studies on the dominant methicillin-resistant
              Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clone USA300. Our data indicate that
              the dynamics of colonization, persistence, and transmission
              differ substantially between USA300-MRSA and ST398-MSSA. Taken
              together, our study reveals local and international routes of
              transmission for a major MSSA clone, indicating key impacts of
              recombination and mutation on genetic diversification and
              highlighting important ecological differences from epidemic
              USA300. Our study demonstrates extensive local and international
              routes of transmission for a major MSSA clone despite the lack of
              substantial antibiotic resistance. IMPORTANCE: Unlike
              methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), surprisingly
              little is known about the clonal evolution of
              methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), although these strains
              account for the majority of S. aureus infections. To better
              understand how MSSA spreads and becomes established in
              communities, we applied comparative bacterial whole-genome
              sequencing to pandemic ST398-MSSA, a clone of clinical importance
              affecting humans and livestock in different geographic regions.
              Phylogeographic analyses identified that ST398-MSSA spread along
              local cultural and migratory links between parts of the
              Caribbean, North America, and France, respectively. We observed
              high within-host SNP variability compared to our previous studies

              clone. These isolates were identified in four cities in Colombia,
              South America. METHODS: The isolates were recovered from four
              different epidemiological and prospective studies that were
              conducted in several regions of Colombia. Molecular
              characterizations included multilocus sequence typing;
              pulsed-field gel electrophoresis; SCCmec, agr and spa typing; and
              whole-genome sequencing. RESULTS: All isolates belonged to ST923
              (clonal complex 8), harbouring SCCmec IVa and a spa type t1635

              person-to-person transmission of healthcare-associated infection,
              which has been a major impediment to optimal management. DESIGN:
              The authors used Illumina MiSeq benchtop sequencing to undertake
              case studies investigating potential outbreaks of
              methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and
              Clostridium difficile. SETTING: Isolates were obtained from
              potential outbreaks associated with three UK hospitals.
              PARTICIPANTS: Isolates were sequenced from a cluster of eight
              MRSA carriers and an associated bacteraemia case in an intensive
              care unit, another MRSA cluster of six cases and two clusters of
              C difficile. Additionally, all C difficile isolates from cases
              over 6 weeks in a single hospital were rapidly sequenced and
              compared with local strain sequences obtained in the preceding 3
              years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Whole-genome genetic relatedness of
              the isolates within each epidemiological cluster. RESULTS:
              Twenty-six MRSA and 15 C difficile isolates were successfully
              sequenced and analysed within 5 days of culture. Both MRSA
              clusters were identified as outbreaks, with most sequences in
              each cluster indistinguishable and all within three single
              nucleotide variants (SNVs). Epidemiologically unrelated isolates
              of the same spa-type were genetically distinct ($\geq$21 SNVs).
              In both C difficile clusters, closely epidemiologically linked
              cases (in one case sharing the same strain type) were shown to be
              genetically distinct ($\geq$144 SNVs). A reconstruction applying
              rapid sequencing in C difficile surveillance provided early
              outbreak detection and identified previously undetected probable
              community transmission. CONCLUSIONS: This benchtop sequencing
              technology is widely generalisable to human bacterial pathogens.
              The findings provide several good examples of how rapid and
              precise sequencing could transform identification of transmission

              a global human health problem causing infections in both
              hospitals and the community. Companion animals, such as cats,
              dogs, and horses, are also frequently colonized by MRSA and can
              become infected. We sequenced the genomes of 46 multilocus
              sequence type (ST) 22 MRSA isolates from cats and dogs in the
              United Kingdom and compared these to an extensive population
              framework of human isolates from the same lineage. Phylogenomic
              analyses showed that all companion animal isolates were
              interspersed throughout the epidemic MRSA-15 (EMRSA-15) pandemic
              clade and clustered with human isolates from the United Kingdom,
              with human isolates basal to those from companion animals,
              suggesting a human source for isolates infecting companion
              animals. A number of isolates from the same veterinary hospital
              clustered together, suggesting that as in human hospitals,
              EMRSA-15 isolates are readily transmitted in the veterinary
              hospital setting. Genome-wide association analysis did not
              identify any host-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
              or virulence factors. However, isolates from companion animals
              were significantly less likely to harbor a plasmid encoding
              erythromycin resistance. When this plasmid was present in
              animal-associated isolates, it was more likely to contain
              mutations mediating resistance to clindamycin. This finding is
              consistent with the low levels of erythromycin and high levels of
              clindamycin used in veterinary medicine in the United Kingdom.
              This study furthers the ``one health'' view of infectious
              diseases that the pathogen pool of human and animal populations
              are intrinsically linked and provides evidence that antibiotic
              usage in animal medicine is shaping the population of a major
              human pathogen. IMPORTANCE: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
              aureus (MRSA) is major problem in human medicine. Companion
              animals, such as cats, dogs, and horses, can also become
              colonized and infected by MRSA. Here, we demonstrate that a
              shared population of an important and globally disseminated
              lineage of MRSA can infect both humans and companion animals
              without undergoing host adaptation. This suggests that companion
              animals might act as a reservoir for human infections. We also
              show that the isolates from companion animals have differences in
              the presence of certain antibiotic resistance genes. This study
              furthers the ``one health'' view of infectious diseases by
              demonstrating that the pool of MRSA isolates in the human and
              animal populations are shared and highlights how different
              antibiotic usage patterns between human and veterinary medicine
              can shape the population of bacterial pathogens.",

              system for excreting extracellular proteins across bacterial cell
              membranes and has been associated with virulence in
              Staphylococcus aureus. The genetic diversity of the ess locus,
              which encodes the T7SS, and the functions of proteins encoded
              within it are poorly understood. RESULTS: We used whole genome
              sequence data from 153 isolates representative of the diversity
              of the species to investigate the genetic variability of T7SS
              across S. aureus. The ess loci were found to comprise of four
              distinct modules based on gene content and relative conservation.
              Modules 1 and 4, comprising of the 5' and 3' modules of the ess
              locus, contained the most conserved clusters of genes across the
              species. Module 1 contained genes encoding the secreted protein
              EsxA, and the EsaAB and EssAB components of the T7SS machinery,
              and Module 4 contained two functionally uncharacterized conserved
              membrane proteins. Across the species four variants of Module 2
              were identified containing the essC gene, each of which was
              associated with a specific group of downstream genes. The most
              diverse module of the ess locus was Module 3 comprising a highly
              variable arrangement of hypothetical proteins. RNA-Seq was
              performed on representatives of the four Module 2 variants and
              demonstrated strain-specific differences in the levels of
              transcription in the conserved Module 1 components and
              transcriptional linkage Module 2, and provided evidence of the
              expression of genes the variable regions of the ess loci.
              CONCLUSIONS: The ess locus of S. aureus exhibits modularity and
              organisational variation across the species and transcriptional
              variation. In silico analysis of ess loci encoded hypothetical
              proteins identified potential novel secreted substrates for the
              T7SS. The considerable variety in operon arrangement between
              otherwise closely related isolates provides strong evidence for
              recombination at this locus. Comparison of these recombination
              regions with each other, and with the genomes of other
              Staphylococcal species, failed to identify evidence of intra- and
              inter-species recombination, however the analysis identified a

               infections potentially life-threatening. A thorough
               understanding of the mechanisms by which resistance spreads
               between patients in different hospitals is required in order to
               design effective control strategies. We measured the differences

               Kingdom and Ireland, using whole-genome sequences from 1085 MRSA
               clonal complex 22 isolates collected between 1998 and 2012. The
               genetic differences between bacterial populations were compared
               with the number of patients transferred between hospitals and
               their regional structure. The MRSA populations within single
               hospitals, regions and countries were genetically distinct from
               the rest of the bacterial population at each of these levels.
               Hospitals from the same patient referral regions showed more
               similar MRSA populations, as did hospitals sharing many
               patients. Furthermore, the bacterial populations from different
               time-periods within the same hospital were generally more
               similar to each other than contemporaneous bacterial populations
               from different hospitals. We conclude that, while a large part
               of the dispersal and expansion of MRSA takes place among
               patients seeking care in single hospitals, inter-hospital spread
               of resistant bacteria is by no means a rare occurrence.
               Hospitals are exposed to constant introductions of MRSA on a
               number of levels: (1) most MRSA is received from hospitals that
               directly transfer large numbers of patients, while (2) fewer
               introductions happen between regions or (3) across national
               borders, reflecting lower numbers of transferred patients. A
               joint coordinated control effort between hospitals, is therefore
               paramount for the national control of MRSA, antibiotic-resistant

              cause infections in humans. Our findings highlight the risk that
              the ST398 lineage will increase its threat to public health by
              continuing to acquire virulence and/or multiple

              background of ST88 CA-MRSA isolates from Ghana and to describe in
              detail ST88 CA-MRSA isolates in comparison with other MRSA
              lineages worldwide. METHODS: We first established a complete ST88
              reference genome (AUS0325) using PacBio SMRT sequencing. We then
              used comparative genomics to assess relatedness among 17 ST88
              CA-MRSA isolates recovered from patients attending Buruli ulcer
              treatment centres in Ghana, three non-African ST88s and 15 other
              MRSA lineages. RESULTS: We show that Ghanaian ST88 forms a
              discrete MRSA lineage (harbouring SCCmec-IV [2B]). Gene content
              analysis identified five distinct genomic regions enriched among
              ST88 isolates compared with the other S. aureus lineages. The
              Ghanaian ST88 isolates had only 658 core genome SNPs and there
              was no correlation between phylogeny and geography, suggesting
              the recent spread of this clone. The lineage was also resistant
              to multiple classes of antibiotics including $\beta$-lactams,
              tetracycline and chloramphenicol. DISCUSSION: This study reveals
              that S. aureus ST88-IV is a recently emerging and rapidly
              spreading CA-MRSA clone in Ghana. The study highlights the

              Data about multidrug resistant bacteria (MDR) prevalence are not

              heath care systems, data about colonisation rates regarding
              highly resistant bacterial pathogens are important. METHODS: We
              performed a cross-sectional screening in four Swiss refugee
              centres to determine the colonization rates for MRSA and ESBL-
              and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. We used
              pharyngeal, nasal, and inguinal swabs for MRSA and rectal swabs
              and urine for ESBL and carbapenemase screening using standard
              microbiological procedures. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was
              used to determine the relatedness of MRSA isolates with high
              resolution due to a suspected outbreak. RESULTS: 41/261(15.7\%)
              refugees were colonized with MRSA. No differences regarding the
              country of origin were observed. However, in a single centre
              significantly more were colonized, which was confirmed to be a
              recent local outbreak. 57/241 (23.7\%) refugees were colonized
              with ESBL with significantly higher colonisation in persons
              originating from the Middle East (35.1\%, p<0.001). No
              carbapenemase producers were detected. CONCLUSION: The
              colonisation rate of the refugees was about 10 times higher for
              MRSA and 2-5 times higher for ESBL compared to the Swiss
              population. Contact precaution is warranted for these persons if
              they enter medical care. In cases of infections, MRSA and

              distinct from each other and more recombination events were

              recombination events in 33 genes along the branch extending to
              the poultry-specific CC5 cluster, and 47 genes were found more

              community-associated (CA) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
              aureus (MRSA) strains have emerged to become frequent causes of
              hospital infection. The aim of this study was to use spatial
              models with adjustment for area-level hospital attendance to
              determine the transmission niche of genotypically defined CA- and
              health-care-associated (HA)-MRSA strains across a diverse region
              of South East London and to explore a potential link between MRSA
              carriage and markers of social and material deprivation. METHODS
              AND FINDINGS: This study involved spatial analysis of
              cross-sectional data linked with all MRSA isolates identified by
              three National Health Service (NHS) microbiology laboratories
              between 1 November 2011 and 29 February 2012. The cohort of
              hospital-based NHS microbiology diagnostic services serves
              867,254 usual residents in the Lambeth, Southwark, and Lewisham
              boroughs in South East London, United Kingdom (UK). Isolates were
              classified as HA- or CA-MRSA based on whole genome sequencing.
              All MRSA cases identified over 4 mo within the three-borough
              catchment area (n = 471) were mapped to small geographies and
              linked to area-level aggregated socioeconomic and demographic
              data. Disease mapping and ecological regression models were used
              to infer the most likely transmission niches for each MRSA
              genetic classification and to describe the spatial epidemiology
              of MRSA in relation to social determinants. Specifically, we
              aimed to identify demographic and socioeconomic population traits
              that explain cross-area extra variation in HA- and CA-MRSA
              relative risks following adjustment for hospital attendance data.
              We explored the potential for associations with the English
              Indices of Deprivation 2010 (including the Index of Multiple
              Deprivation and several deprivation domains and subdomains) and
              the 2011 England and Wales census demographic and socioeconomic
              indicators (including numbers of households by deprivation
              dimension) and indicators of population health. Both CA-and
              HA-MRSA were associated with household deprivation (CA-MRSA
              relative risk [RR]: 1.72 [1.03-2.94]; HA-MRSA RR: 1.57
              [1.06-2.33]), which was correlated with hospital attendance
              (Pearson correlation coefficient [PCC] = 0.76). HA-MRSA was also
              associated with poor health (RR: 1.10 [1.01-1.19]) and residence
              in communal care homes (RR: 1.24 [1.12-1.37]), whereas CA-MRSA
              was linked with household overcrowding (RR: 1.58 [1.04-2.41]) and
              wider barriers, which represent a combined score for household
              overcrowding, low income, and homelessness (RR: 1.76
              [1.16-2.70]). CA-MRSA was also associated with recent immigration
              to the UK (RR: 1.77 [1.19-2.66]). For the area-level variation in
              RR for CA-MRSA, 28.67\% was attributable to the spatial
              arrangement of target geographies, compared with only 0.09\% for
              HA-MRSA. An advantage to our study is that it provided a
              representative sample of usual residents receiving care in the
              catchment areas. A limitation is that relationships apparent in
              aggregated data analyses cannot be assumed to operate at the
              individual level. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of community
              transmission of HA-MRSA strains, implying that HA-MRSA cases
              identified in the community originate from the hospital reservoir
              and are maintained by frequent attendance at health care
              facilities. In contrast, there was a high risk of CA-MRSA in
              deprived areas linked with overcrowding, homelessness, low
              income, and recent immigration to the UK, which was not
              explainable by health care exposure. Furthermore, areas adjacent
              to these deprived areas were themselves at greater risk of
              CA-MRSA, indicating community transmission of CA-MRSA. This
              ongoing community transmission could lead to CA-MRSA becoming the
              dominant strain types carried by patients admitted to hospital,
              particularly if successful hospital-based MRSA infection control
              programmes are maintained. These results suggest that community
              infection control programmes targeting transmission of CA-MRSA
              will be required to control MRSA in both the community and
              hospital. These epidemiological changes will also have
              implications for effectiveness of risk-factor-based hospital
              admission MRSA screening programmes.",

              declining over the past decade, but changes in S. aureus overall
              and the implications for trends in antibiotic resistance remain
              unclear. Objective: To determine whether the decline in rates of
              infection by MRSA has been accompanied by changes in rates of
              infection by methicillin susceptible, penicillin resistant S.
              aureus (MSSA) and penicillin susceptible S. aureus (PSSA). We
              test if these dynamics are associated with specific genetic
              lineages and evaluate gains and losses of resistance at the
              strain level. Methods: We conducted a 15 year retrospective
              observational study at two tertiary care institutions in Boston,
              MA of 31,589 adult inpatients with S. aureus infections.
              Surveillance swabs and duplicate specimens were excluded. We also
              sequenced a sample of contemporary isolates (n = 180) obtained
              between January 2016 and July 2016. We determined changes in the
              annual rates of infection per 1,000 inpatient admissions by S.
              aureus subtype and in the annual mean antibiotic resistance by
              subtype. We performed phylogenetic analysis to generate a
              population structure and infer gain and loss of the genetic
              determinants of resistance. Results: Of the 43,954 S. aureus
              infections over the study period, 21,779 were MRSA, 17,565 MSSA
              and 4,610 PSSA. After multivariate adjustment, annual rates of
              infection by S. aureus declined from 2003 to 2014 by 2.9\% (95\%
              CI, 1.6\%-4.3\%), attributable to an annual decline in MRSA of
              9.1\% (95\% CI, 6.3\%-11.9\%) and in MSSA by 2.2\% (95\% CI,
              0.4\%-4.0\%). PSSA increased over this time period by 4.6\% (95\%
              CI, 3.0\%-6.3\%) annually. Resistance in S. aureus decreased from
              2000 to 2014 by 0.86 antibiotics (95\% CI, 0.81-0.91). By
              phylogenetic inference, 5/35 MSSA and 2/20 PSSA isolates in the
              common MRSA lineages ST5/USA100 and ST8/USA300 arose from the
              loss of genes conferring resistance. Conclusions and relevance:
              At two large tertiary care centers in Boston, MA, S. aureus
              infections have decreased in rate and have become more
              susceptible to antibiotics, with a rise in PSSA making penicillin
              an increasingly viable and important treatment option.",

              acquired gene encoding an extra penicillin-binding protein
              (PBP2a) with low affinity to virtually all $\beta$-lactams. The
              introduction of mecA into the S. aureus chromosome has led to the
              emergence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) pandemics,
              responsible for high rates of mortality worldwide. Nonetheless,
              little is known regarding the origin and evolution of mecA.
              Different mecA homologues have been identified in species
              belonging to the Staphylococcus sciuri group representing the
              most primitive staphylococci. In this study we aimed to identify
              evolutionary steps linking these mecA precursors to the
              $\beta$-lactam resistance gene mecA and the resistance phenotype.
              We sequenced genomes of 106 S. sciuri, S. vitulinus and S.
              fleurettii strains and determined their oxacillin susceptibility
              profiles. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of the
              core genome was performed to assess the genetic relatedness of
              the isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of the mecA gene homologues
              and promoters was achieved through nucleotide/amino acid sequence
              alignments and mutation rates were estimated using a Bayesian
              analysis. Furthermore, the predicted structure of mecA
              homologue-encoded PBPs of oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant
              strains were compared. We showed for the first time that
              oxacillin resistance in the S. sciuri group has emerged multiple
              times and by a variety of different mechanisms. Development of
              resistance occurred through several steps including structural
              diversification of the non-binding domain of native PBPs; changes
              in the promoters of mecA homologues; acquisition of SCCmec and
              adaptation of the bacterial genetic background. Moreover, our
              results suggest that it was exposure to $\beta$-lactams in
              human-created environments that has driven evolution of native
              PBPs towards a resistance determinant. The evolution of
              $\beta$-lactam resistance in staphylococci highlights the
              numerous resources available to bacteria to adapt to the

              performed WGS on clinical isolates. We then linked genomic,
              phylogenetic data, epidemiologic, and clinical data in order to
              evaluate intra- and interclass disease transmission. Furthermore,
              among cases of recurrent MRSA SSTI, we evaluated the intrahost
              relatedness of infecting strains. Results.: Nine training classes
              with $\geq$5 cases of USA300 MRSA SSTI were selected. Eighty
              USA300 MRSA clinical isolates from 74 trainees, six (8.1\%) of
              whom had recurrent infection, were subjected to WGS. We
              identified 2719 single nucleotide variants (SNV). The overall
              median (range) SNV difference between isolates was 173 (1-339).
              Intraclass median SNV differences ranged from 23 to 245. Two
              phylogenetic clusters were suggestive of interclass MRSA
              transmission. One of these clusters stemmed from two classes that
              were separated by a 13-month period but housed in the same
              barracks. Among trainees with recurrent MRSA SSTI, the intrahost
              median SNV difference was 7.5 (1-48). Conclusions.: Application
              of WGS revealed intra- and interclass transmission of MRSA among
              military trainees. An interclass cluster between two
              non-contemporaneous classes suggests a long-term reservoir for
              MRSA in this setting.",

              were compared with the routine investigation results and
              epidemiological evidence.Outbreaks with epidemiological evidence
              for an LTC source had a mean estimated TMRCA (adjusted for

              involvement with a sensitivity of 0.875 and a specificity of 1.We
              also found 6/20 outbreaks included isolates with differing
              antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, however, these had only
              modestly increased pairwise diversity (mean 17.5 single

              involvement of LTCs in outbreaks to be identified and could be
              used to decide whether screening for long-term carriage (e.g. in
              healthcare workers) is warranted. Requiring identical

              aureus isolates were collected from respiratory cultures of 115
              CF patients during a 22 month study period. Whole genome
              sequencing was performed and using SNP analysis, phylogenetic
              trees were assembled to determine relatedness between isolates.
              MRSA phenotypes were predicted using PPFS2 and compared to the
              observed phenotype. The accumulation of SNPs in multiple isolates
              obtained over time from the same patient was examined to
              determine if a genomic molecular clock could be calculated.Pairs

              epidemiology, namely community-associated (CA) and
              hospital-associated (HA) MRSA. Notably, the distinction of CA-
              and HA-MRSA based on molecular traits remains difficult due to
              the high genomic plasticity of S. aureus. Here we sought to
              pinpoint global distinguishing features of CA- and HA-MRSA
              through a comparative genome and proteome analysis of the
              notorious MRSA lineage USA300. We show for the first time that
              CA- and HA-MRSA isolates can be distinguished by two distinct
              extracellular protein abundance clusters that are predictive not
              only for epidemiologic behavior, but also for their growth and
              survival within epithelial cells. This 'exoproteome profiling'
              also groups more distantly related HA-MRSA isolates into the HA
              exoproteome cluster. Comparative genome analysis suggests that
              these distinctive features of CA- and HA-MRSA isolates relate

              identified exoproteome clusters differ in the relative abundance
              of typical cytoplasmic proteins, suggesting that signatures of
              cytoplasmic proteins in the exoproteome represent a new
              distinguishing feature of CA- and HA-MRSA. Our comparative genome

              Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is a significant bacterial
              pathogen that poses considerable clinical and public health
              challenges. The majority of the CA-MRSA disease burden consists
              of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) not associated with
              significant morbidity; however, CA-MRSA also causes severe,
              invasive infections resulting in significant morbidity and
              mortality. The broad range of disease severity may be influenced
              by bacterial genetic variation. RESULTS: We sequenced the
              complete genomes of 36 CA-MRSA clinical isolates from the
              predominant North American community acquired clonal type USA300
              (18 SSTI and 18 severe infection-associated isolates). While all
              36 isolates shared remarkable genetic similarity, we found
              greater overall time-dependent sequence diversity among SSTI
              isolates. In addition, pathway analysis of non-synonymous
              variations revealed increased sequence diversity in the putative
              virulence genes of SSTI isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Here we report the

              USA300 lineage and describe the evolution of the pathogen over
              time within a defined geographic area. The results demonstrate

  abstract  = "Most bacteria that associate with animals do not cause harm, and
               many are essential to health or provide other benefits. An
               animal's immune system must permit these beneficial associations
               and at the same time block harmful microbes. This ultimately
               means that even beneficial bacteria must adapt to the immune
               barriers that they encounter. Different species that live in a
               close relationship with each other are known as symbionts. A
               species of bacteria called Vibrio fischeri can form a mutually
               beneficial symbiotic relationship with squid. The squid provide
               food for the bacteria, but only the bacteria that successfully
               navigate immune barriers and reach the squid's ``light organ''
               are fed. In return, the bacteria produce bioluminescence, making
               the nocturnal squid appear like moonlight in the water. As the
               bacteria reproduce, some individuals randomly acquire genetic
               mutations, some of which might improve the bacteria's chances of
               survival. Which mutations and associated traits allow bacteria
               to beat out the competition and evolve to become animal
               symbionts? To investigate, Pankey, Foxall et al. grew V.
               fischeri bacteria from several ancestors that were poor at
               colonizing squid. Groups of newly hatched squid selected
               potential symbionts from the resulting mix of bacteria. The
               selected symbionts were allowed to reproduce within the squid to
               form a new population of bacteria and were later vented out for
               a new batch of squid to sort through. This was repeated to
               ultimately form a final group of bacteria that had passed
               through 15 squid in turn. Unexpectedly, the bacteria in the
               final group all found the same solution to help them adapt to
               symbiotic life with the squid: mutations to the gene that
               encodes a signaling protein called BinK. Eight distinct
               mutations arose that dramatically changed how the bacteria
               interacted with squid. The evolved bacteria created a coating
               that hid them from squid immune cells and protected them from
               chemicals that squid use to kill invaders. The mutations also
               altered how the bacteria communicated with each other. This
               adjusted the intensity of light that they produced for their
               host to a more natural level, and improved their ability to grow
               on squid-provided food. Overall, the results presented by
               Pankey, Foxall et al. demonstrate that small genetic mutations
               can transform non-symbionts into symbionts, enabling them to
               evolve rapidly to form a symbiosis with a new host. This
               demonstrates that these bacteria already had the ability to
               coordinate the complex behaviors necessary to overcome the
               multiple barriers provided to them by the squid immune system.
               Other beneficial animal--bacteria associations are likely to
               work on similar principles; the study exemplifies the utility of
               experimental evolution systems and lays a foundation for further
               work to investigate these principles in more detail.",

              on three mobile genetic elements: TW carries SCCmec Type VT,

              was confirmed using murine skin and bloodstream infection models.
              $\Phi$Sa3 usually integrates into the hlb gene, but in AP was

              CA-MRSA. The prevailing European CA-MRSA clone carries a type IVc
              staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) and expresses
              Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). Recently, a significant
              increase of PVL-negative CC80 MRSA has been observed in Denmark.
              The aim of this study was to examine the genetics and the
              epidemiology of these, and to compare them to the European
              CA-MRSA clone in order to understand the emergence of
              PVL-negative CC80 MRSA. METHODS: Phylogenetic analysis of the
              CC80 S. aureus lineage was conducted from whole-genome sequences
              of 217 isolates (23 MSSA and 194 MRSA) from 22 countries. All
              isolates were further genetically characterized in regard to
              resistance determinants and PVL carriage, and epidemiological
              data was obtained for selected isolates. RESULTS: The
              phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of three distinct
              clades of the CC80 lineage: i) an MSSA clade encompassing
              Sub-Saharan African isolates (n=13); ii) a derived clade
              encompassing the European CA-MRSA SCCmec-IVc clone (n=185); and
              iii) a novel and genetically distinct clade encompassing MRSA
              SCCmec-IVa isolates (n=19). All isolates in the novel clade were
              PVL negative, but carried remnant parts (8 -12 kb) of the
              PVL-encoding prophage $\Phi$Sa2, and were susceptible to fusidic
              acid and kanamycin/amikacin. Geospatial mapping could link these
              isolates to regions in the Middle East, Asia and South Pacific.
              CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the emergence of a novel CC80
              CA-MRSA sub-lineage, showing that the CC80 lineage is more
              diverse than previously assumed.",

              described as a divergent lineage of Staphylococcus aureus that
              has recently been shown to have a global distribution. Despite
              growing evidence of the clinical importance of this species,
              knowledge about its population epidemiology and genomic
              architecture is limited. We used whole-genome sequencing to
              evaluate and compare S. aureus (n = 251) and S. argenteus (n =
              68) isolates from adults with staphylococcal sepsis at several
              hospitals in northeastern Thailand between 2006 and 2013. The
              majority (82\%) of the S. argenteus isolates were of multilocus
              sequence type 2250 (ST2250). S. aureus was more diverse, although
              43\% of the isolates belonged to ST121. Bayesian analysis
              suggested an S. argenteus ST2250 substitution rate of 4.66 (95\%
              confidence interval [CI], 3.12 to 6.38) mutations per genome per
              year, which was comparable to the S. aureus ST121 substitution
              rate of 4.07 (95\% CI, 2.61 to 5.55). S. argenteus ST2250 emerged
              in Thailand an estimated 15 years ago, which contrasts with the
              S. aureus ST1, ST88, and ST121 clades that emerged around 100 to
              150 years ago. Comparison of S. argenteus ST2250 genomes from
              Thailand and a global collection indicated a single introduction
              into Thailand, followed by transmission to local and more distant
              countries in Southeast Asia and further afield. S. argenteus and
              S. aureus shared around half of their core gene repertoire,
              indicating a high level of divergence and providing strong
              support for their classification as separate species. Several
              gene clusters were present in ST2250 isolates but absent from the
              other S. argenteus and S. aureus study isolates. These included
              multiple exotoxins and antibiotic resistance genes that have been

              caused by the mecA gene, which is carried on a mobile genetic
              element: the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec).
              Horizontal transfer of this element is supposed to play an
              important factor in the emergence of new clones of
              methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), but has been
              rarely observed in real-time.In 2012, an outbreak occurred
              involving a healthcare worker (HCW) and three patients all
              carrying a fusidic-acid resistant MRSA strain. The husband of the
              HCW was screened for MRSA carriage, but only a
              methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was detected, which was
              also resistant for fusidic acid. Multiple Locus Variable-number
              Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA)-typing showed that both the MSSA
              and the MRSA isolates were MT4053-MC0005. This finding led to the
              hypothesis that the MSSA strain acquired the SCCmec and
              subsequently caused an outbreak. To support this hypothesis,
              next-generation sequencing of the MSSA and MRSA isolates was
              performed.This study showed that the MSSA isolate clustered
              closely with the outbreak isolates based on whole-genome
              multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST) and the single nucleotide
              polymorphism (SNP) analysis, with a distance of 17 genes and 44
              SNPs, respectively. Remarkably, there were relatively large
              differences in mobile genetic elements in strains within and
              between individuals.The limited genetic distance between the MSSA
              and the MRSA isolates in combination with a clear epidemiologic
              link, support the hypothesis that the MSSA isolate acquired a
              SCCmec and that the resulting MRSA strain caused an
              outbreak.IMPORTANCE This report shows that acquisition of the
              staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) by a
              methicillin-susceptible S. aureus does occur. In this case it
              concerned a healthcare worker (HCW) and this subsequently caused
              an outbreak in a vulnerable group of patients. The whole genome
              sequence based analysis further showed that considerable genetic
              variability occurred in a relatively short time span. These
              findings are important to reconsider the exclusion of HCW with
              regard to control measures for methicillin-resistant S. aureus

              be larger than currently assumed.",

              chronic infection. During biofilm formation, a subset of cells
              liberate cytoplasmic proteins and DNA, which are repurposed to
              form the extracellular matrix that binds the remaining cells
              together in large clusters. Using a strain that forms robust
              biofilms in vitro during growth under glucose supplementation, we
              carried out a genome-wide screen for genes involved in the
              release of extracellular DNA (eDNA). A high-density transposon

              emergence, dissemination and global distribution of epidemic
              clones of bacteria is limited. ST59 is a major epidemic clone of
              community-associated MRSA in East Asia, responsible for extensive
              morbidity and mortality, but has a much lower prevalence in other
              parts of the world. The geographic origin of ST59 and its
              international routes of dissemination are unclear and disputed in
              the literature. RESULTS: To investigate the origin and spread of
              the ST59 clone, we obtained whole genome sequences of isolates
              from four continents, sampled over more than a decade, and
              carried out a time-scaled phylogeographic analysis. We discover
              that two distinct ST59 clades emerged concurrently, in East Asia
              and the USA, but underwent clonal expansion at different times.
              The East Asia clade was strongly enriched for gene determinants
              associated with antibiotic resistance, consistent with regional
              differences in antibiotic usage. Both clones spread independently
              to Australia and Europe, and we found evidence of the persistence
              of multi-drug resistance following export from East Asia. Direct
              transfer of strains between Taiwan and the USA was not observed
              in either direction, consistent with geographic niche exclusion.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our results resolve a longstanding controversy
              regarding the origin of the ST59 clone, revealing the major
              global source and sink populations and routes for the spread of
              multi-drug resistant clones. Additionally, our findings indicate

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The spread of drug-resistant bacterial pathogens
              poses a major threat to global health. It is widely recognised
              that the widespread use of antibiotics has generated selective
              pressures that have driven the emergence of resistant strains.
              Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was first
              observed in 1960, less than one year after the introduction of
              this second generation beta-lactam antibiotic into clinical
              practice. Epidemiological evidence has always suggested that
              resistance arose around this period, when the mecA gene encoding
              methicillin resistance carried on an SCCmec element, was
              horizontally transferred to an intrinsically sensitive strain of
              S. aureus. RESULTS: Whole genome sequencing a collection of the
              first MRSA isolates allows us to reconstruct the evolutionary
              history of the archetypal MRSA. We apply Bayesian phylogenetic
              reconstruction to infer the time point at which this early MRSA
              lineage arose and when SCCmec was acquired. MRSA emerged in the
              mid-1940s, following the acquisition of an ancestral type I
              SCCmec element, some 14 years before the first therapeutic use of
              methicillin. CONCLUSIONS: Methicillin use was not the original
              driving factor in the evolution of MRSA as previously thought.
              Rather it was the widespread use of first generation beta-lactams
              such as penicillin in the years prior to the introduction of
              methicillin, which selected for S. aureus strains carrying the
              mecA determinant. Crucially this highlights how new drugs,
              introduced to circumvent known resistance mechanisms, can be
              rendered ineffective by unrecognised adaptations in the bacterial
              population due to the historic selective landscape created by the
              widespread use of other antibiotics.",

              life-threatening conditions. Bloodstream infections are
              particularly important and the treatment approach is complicated
              by the presence of methicillin resistance among S. aureus
              isolates (MRSA). Emergence of new genetic lineages of MRSA has
              occurred in Latin America (LA) with the rise and dissemination of
              the community-associated USA300 Latin American Variant
              (USA300-LV). Here, we prospectively characterized bloodstream
              MRSA recovered from selected hospitals in 9 Latin American
              countries. All isolates were typed by pulsed field gel
              electrophoresis (PFGE) and subjected to antibiotic susceptibility
              testing. Whole genome sequencing was performed in 96 MRSA
              representatives. MRSA represented 45\% of all isolates (out of
              1,185 S. aureus). The majority of MRSA isolates belonged to
              clonal cluster (CC) 5. In Colombia and Ecuador, most isolates
              ($\geq$ 72\%) belonged to the USA300-LV lineage (CC8).
              Phylogenetic reconstructions indicated that MRSA isolates from
              participating hospitals belonged to three major clades. Clade A
              grouped isolates with ST5, ST105, and ST1011 (mostly SCCmec I and
              II). Clade B included ST8, ST88, ST97, and ST72 strains (SCCmec
              IV, subtypes a, b, and c/E) and clade C grouped mostly
              Argentinian MRSA belonging to ST30. In summary, CC5 MRSA was
              prevalent in bloodstream infections in LA with the exception of
              Colombia and Ecuador where USA300-LV is now the dominant lineage.
              Clonal replacement appears to be a common phenomenon and
              continuous surveillance is crucial to identify changes in the
              molecular epidemiology of MRSA.",

              $\varphi$SA3, genomic island $\nu$Sa$\beta$ and MES (an
              enterococcal mobile genetic element conferring multidrug
              resistance) in 195 CC59 S. aureus. Sequencing and PCR mapping
              revealed that all of the CC59/SCCmec V (5C2\&5) MRSA strains had
              acquired MESPM1 or its segregants, and obtained a
              $\varphi$SA3-related fragment in $\nu$Sa$\beta$. In contrast,
              MES6272-2 and MES4578, which showed gentamicin resistance that
              was not encoded by MESPM1, were dominant in SCCmec IVg MRSA.
              Translocation of a whole $\varphi$SA3 into $\nu$Sa$\beta$ instead
              of only a $\varphi$SA3-related fragment was common in SCCmec IVg
              MRSA. However, the non-subtype-g SCCmec IV MRSA (SCCmec IVa is
              the major) still carried MES and $\nu$Sa$\beta$ structures
              similar to those in SCCmec V (5C2\&5) MRSA. A minimum spanning
              tree constructed by multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat
              analysis revealed that SCCmec IVg MRSA and SCCmec V (5C2\&5) MRSA
              grouped respectively in two major clades. The CC59 MSSA was
              equally distributed among the two clades, while the non-subtype-g
              SCCmec IV MRSA mostly clustered with SCCmec V (5C2\&5) MRSA. Our
              findings strongly suggest that CC59 MSSA acquired divergent
              mobile genetic elements and evolved to SCCmec IVg MRSA and SCCmec
              V (5C2\&5) MRSA/non-subtype-g SCCmec IV MRSA independently. The
              evolutionary history of CC59 S. aureus explains how mobile
              genetic elements increase the antimicrobial resistance and
              virulence and contribute to the success of CA-MRSA in Taiwan.",

              with half-lives greater than one-week, to select for resistance
              is unknown. Here we explore a case of MRSA central
              line-associated blood stream infection in which dalbavancin and
              vancomycin non-susceptibility emerged in a urine isolate
              collected after the patient was treated with vancomycin and
              dalbavancin sequentially. METHODS: Isolates from blood and urine
              underwent susceptibility testing, and whole genome sequencing
              (WGS). The blood isolate was subjected to successive passage in
              vitro in the presence of escalating dalbavancin concentrations
              and the emergent isolate was subjected to repeat susceptibility
              testing and WGS. RESULTS: The blood isolate was fully susceptible
              to vancomycin, however, MICs of the urine isolate to dalbavancin,
              vancomycin, telavancin and daptomycin were $\geq$4-fold higher

              indistinguishable by spa and variable number tandem repeat (VNTR)
              typing, and WGS revealed only 7 variants, indicating clonality.
              Four variants affected genes, including a non-synonymous change
              in yvqF, which has been implicated in glycopeptide resistance.
              Vancomycin and dalbavancin non-susceptibility emerged in the
              blood isolate after successive passage in vitro in the presence
              of dalbavancin, and WGS identified a single non-synonymous
              variant in yvqF. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case in which
              VISA has emerged in the context of a dalbavancin-containing
              regimen. The selection for cross-resistance to vancomycin in
              vitro by dalbavancin exposure alone is troubling. Clinicians

              molecular epidemiology of LA-MRSA isolated in the East of England
              (broadly Cambridge and the surrounding area). We accessed whole
              genome sequence data for 2,283 MRSA isolates from 1,465 people
              identified during a 12-month prospective study between 2012 and
              2013 conducted in the East of England, United Kingdom. This
              laboratory serves four hospitals and 75 general practices. We
              screened the collection for multilocus sequence types (STs) and
              for host specific resistance and virulence factors previously
              associated with LA-MRSA. We identified 13 putative LA-MRSA
              isolates from 12 individuals, giving an estimated prevalence of
              0.82\% (95\% CI 0.47\% to 1.43\%). Twelve isolates were mecC-MRSA
              (ten CC130, one ST425 and one ST1943) and single isolate was
              ST398. Our data demonstrate a low burden of LA-MRSA in the East
              of England, but the detection of mecC-MRSA and ST398 indicates
              the need for vigilance. Genomic surveillance provides a mechanism
              to detect and track the emergence and spread of MRSA clones of
              human importance.",

              is caused by a polyclonal methicillin-susceptible (MSSA)
              population. However, MSSA also colonise asymptomatically the
              cornified epithelia of approximately 20\% of the population, and

              health concern. Infection severity, and in particular
              bacteraemia-associated mortality, has been attributed to several
              host-related factors, such as age and the presence of
              comorbidities. The role of the bacterium in infection severity is
              less well understood, as it is complicated by the multifaceted
              nature of bacterial virulence, which has so far prevented a
              robust mapping between genotype, phenotype and infection outcome.
              To investigate the role of bacterial factors in contributing to
              bacteraemia-associated mortality, we phenotyped a collection of
              sequenced clinical S. aureus isolates from patients with
              bloodstream infections, representing two globally important
              clonal types, CC22 and CC30. By adopting a genome-wide
              association study approach we identified and functionally
              verified several genetic loci that affect the expression of
              cytolytic toxicity and biofilm formation. By analysing the pooled
              data comprising bacterial genotype and phenotype together with
              clinical metadata within a machine-learning framework, we found
              significant clonal differences in the determinants most
              predictive of poor infection outcome. Whereas elevated cytolytic
              toxicity in combination with low levels of biofilm formation was
              predictive of an increased risk of mortality in infections by
              strains of a CC22 background, these virulence-specific factors
              had little influence on mortality rates associated with CC30
              infections. Our results therefore suggest that different clones
              may have adopted different strategies to overcome host responses
              and cause severe pathology. Our study further demonstrates the
              use of a combined genomics and data analytic approach to enhance
              our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis at the individual
              level, which will be an important step towards personalized
              medicine and infectious disease management.A genome-wide

              been shown to play a role, e. g. in S. aureus strains displaying
              intermediate resistance to vancomycin (VISA).To characterize the
              IS256 insertion sites in the genomes of two closely related
              sequence type (ST) 247 VISA strains, all insertions were mapped
              in both VISA and a susceptible control strain. The results showed
              that the three ST247 strains contained the highest number so far
              of IS256 insertions of all sequenced S. aureus strains.
              Furthermore, in contrast to the other IS elements in these
              genomes, the IS256 insertion sites were not identical in the
              closely related strains, indicating a high transposition
              frequency of IS256 When IS256 was introduced into a laboratory
              strain which was then cultured in the presence of antibiotics, it
              was possible to isolate small colony variants (SCV) that

              increased resistance to vancomycin and aminoglycosides,

              wild type was observed, that resembled the fast reversion of
              clinical SCV. The reversion was caused by excision of IS256 in a
              small number of fast growing clones that quickly outcompeted the
              SCVs in broth cultures. In conclusion, the presence of IS256

              hospitals (ACHs) and intermediate- and long-term care facilities
              (ILTCFs), the transmission dynamics of MRSA between healthcare
              settings is not well understood. Methods: We conducted a
              cross-sectional study in a network comprising an ACH and 5
              closely affiliated ILTCFs in Singapore. A total of 1700
              inpatients were screened for MRSA over a 6-week period in 2014.
              MRSA isolates underwent whole-genome sequencing, with a pairwise
              single-nucleotide polymorphism (Hamming distance) cutoff of 60
              core genome single-nucleotide polymorphisms used to define recent
              transmission clusters (clades) for the 3 major clones. Results:
              MRSA prevalence was significantly higher in intermediate-term
              (29.9\%) and long-term (20.4\%) care facilities than in the ACH
              (11.8\%) (P < .001). The predominant clones were sequence type
              [ST] 22 (n = 183; 47.8\%), ST45 (n = 129; 33.7\%), and ST239 (n =
              26; 6.8\%), with greater diversity of STs in ILTCFs relative to
              the ACH. A large proportion of the clades in ST22 (14 of 21
              clades; 67\%) and ST45 (7 of 13; 54\%) included inpatients from
              the ACH and ILTCFs. The most frequent source of the interfacility
              transmissions was the ACH (n = 28 transmission events; 36.4\%).
              Conclusions: MRSA transmission dynamics between the ACH and
              ILTCFs were complex. The greater diversity of STs in ILTCFs
              suggests that the ecosystem in such settings might be more
              conducive for intrafacility transmission events. ST22 and ST45

              aureus virulence is controlled by the agr quorum sensing system
              responding to secreted auto-inducing peptides (AIPs) sensed by
              AgrC, a two component histidine kinase. agr loci are found also

              regulated virulence genes in S. aureus. In this study we aimed to
              better understand the interaction between staphylococci and S.
              aureus, and show that this interaction may eventually lead to the
              identification of new anti-virulence candidates to target S.
              aureus infections. Here we show that culture supernatants of 37
              out of 52 staphylococcal isolates representing 17 different
              species inhibit S. aureus agr. The dog pathogen, Staphylococcus
              schleiferi, expressed the most potent inhibitory activity and was
              active against all four agr classes found in S. aureus. By
              employing a S. aureus strain encoding a constitutively active AIP
              receptor we show that the activity is mediated via agr.
              Subsequent cloning and heterologous expression of the S.
              schleiferi AIP in S. aureus demonstrated that this molecule was
              likely responsible for the inhibitory activity, and further proof
              was provided when pure synthetic S. schleiferi AIP was able to
              completely abolish agr induction of an S. aureus reporter strain.
              To assess impact on S. aureus virulence, we co-inoculated S.
              aureus and S. schleiferi in vivo in the Galleria mellonella wax
              moth larva, and found that expression of key S. aureus virulence
              factors was abrogated. Our data show that the S. aureus agr locus
              is highly responsive to other staphylococcal species suggesting
              that agr is an inter-species communication system. Based on these
              results we speculate that interactions between S. aureus and
              other colonizing staphylococci will significantly influence the
              ability of S. aureus to cause infection, and we propose that
              other staphylococci are potential sources of compounds that can

              is a central responsibility in the healthcare environment, and
              accurate identification of transmission events presents the first
              challenge. Phylogenetic analysis based on whole genome sequencing
              provides a high-resolution approach for accurately relating
              isolates to one another, allowing precise identification or
              exclusion of transmission events and sources for nearly all
              cases. We sequenced 24 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
              aureus (MRSA) genomes to retrospectively investigate a suspected
              point source of three surgical site infections (SSIs) that
              occurred over a one-year period. The source of transmission was
              believed to be a surgical team member colonized with MRSA,
              involved in all surgeries preceding the SSI cases, who was
              subsequently decolonized. Genetic relatedness among isolates was
              determined using whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism
              (SNP) data. RESULTS: Whole genome SNP typing (WGST) revealed 283
              informative SNPs between the surgical team member's isolate and
              the closest SSI isolate. The second isolate was 286 and the third
              was thousands of SNPs different, indicating the nasal carriage
              strain from the surgical team member was not the source of the
              SSIs. Given the mutation rates estimated for S. aureus, none of
              the SSI isolates share a common ancestor within the past 16
              years, further discounting any common point source for these
              infections. The decolonization procedures and resources spent on
              the point source infection control could have been prevented if
              WGST was performed at the time of the suspected transmission,
              instead of retrospectively. CONCLUSIONS: Whole genome sequence
              analysis is an ideal method to exclude isolates involved in
              transmission events and nosocomial outbreaks, and coupling this
              method with epidemiological data can determine if a transmission
              event occurred. These methods promise to direct infection control

              aureus is poorly described for surgeons, despite the increased

              investigated the molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial
              resistance of 26 MRSA isolates cultured from the nares of an
              international cross-sectional study of 1,166 human and 60
              veterinary surgeons. All isolates were subjected to agr-, spa-
              and MLST typing and the presence of 22 virulence factors were
              screened for by PCR. Additionally, biofilm-forming ability,
              haemolytic activity, staphyloxanthin production and antibiotic
              resistance were determined. The genome of a rifampicin resistant
              MRSA was sequenced. Approximately half of the isolates belonged
              to well-described clonal lineages, ST1, ST5, ST8, ST45 and ST59,
              that have been previously associated with severe infections and
              increased patient mortality. Two of the 3 veterinarian MRSA
              belonged to epidemic livestock-associated MRSA clonal lineages
              (ST398 and ST8) previously associated with high transmission
              potential between animals and humans. The isolates did not
              display any consistent virulence gene pattern, and 35\% of the
              isolates carried at least one of: the Panton-Valentine leukocidin
              lukFS-PV; the exfoliative toxin eta; or the toxic shock syndrome
              tst genes. Resistance to rifampicin was detected in one
              veterinarian isolate, and was found to be due to 3 mutations in
              the rpoB gene. Surgeons occupy a critical position in the
              healthcare profession due to their close contact with patients.
              In this study, surgeons were found to be colonized with MRSA at
              low rates that are similar to the general population, and the
              colonising strains were often common clonal lineages.",

  author   = "Bayer, Arnold S and Mishra, Nagendra N and Cheung, Ambrose L and
              Rubio, Aileen and Yang, Soo-Jin",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In small series or individual reports, SNPs within
              the mprF ORF and dysregulation of its expression in
              Staphylococcus aureus have been linked to daptomycin resistance
              (DAP-R) via a proposed gain-in-function mechanism. Similarly,
              dysregulation of dltABCD has also been associated with DAP-R.
              METHODS: Using 22 well-characterized, isogenic
              daptomycin-susceptible (DAP-S)/DAP-R clinical MRSA strain pairs,
              we assessed potential relationships of the DAP-R phenotype with:
              (i) regulation of mprF transcription; (ii) regulation of dltABCD
              transcription; (iii) expression of the two-component regulatory
              system, graRS (upstream regulator for both mprF and dltABCD
              transcription); (iv) SNPs within the graRS promoter or its ORF;
              and (v) altered mprF transcription and lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol
              (L-PG) synthesis. RESULTS: Enhanced expression of mprF occurred
              with SNPs in highly distinct and well-chronicled MprF domain 'hot
              spots' and rarely occurred without such mutations. Increased
              expression and/or dysregulation of mprF and dltABCD were not
              uncommon in DAP-R strains, occurring in 27\% of strains for each
              gene. In these latter strains, neither graRS expression profiles
              nor polymorphic sequences within the graRS promoter or ORF could
              be significantly linked to altered transcription of mprF or dlt.
              CONCLUSIONS: Although graRS can co-regulate mprF and dltABCD
              expression, loci outside of this regulon appear to be involved in
              dysregulation of these latter two genes and the DAP-R phenotype.
              Finally, DAP-R strains exhibiting significantly altered mprF
              transcription profiles produced significantly increased levels of

              determinants responsible for antibiotic resistance and for
              virulence. RESULTS: Ten out of 12 strains belonged to the MLST
              ST2625, while the other two were ST8. Among the ST2625 strains,
              analysis based on 1126 genes showed that they were clonal sharing
              more than 98.3\% of allelic identities and one of them was

              ``slow-VISA,'' in which colonies appear only after 72 h of
              incubation. Slow-VISA strains can be difficult to detect because
              prolonged incubation is required and the phenotype is unstable.
              To develop a method for detection of slow-VISA isolates, we
              studied 23 slow-VISA isolates derived from heteroVISA clinical
              strain Mu3. We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)
              in genes involved in various pathways such as purine/pyrimidine
              synthesis, cell metabolism, and cell-wall peptidoglycan
              synthesis, which have been implicated in the stringent response.
              We found that mupirocin, which also induces a stringent response,
              caused stable expression of vancomycin resistance. On the basis
              of these results, we developed a method for detection of
              slow-VISA using mupirocin 0.032 $\mu$g/ml (Patent Application No.
              PCT/JP2017/008975filed on March 7, 2017). Using this method, we

              methicillin-resistant S.aureus (MRSA) isolates. In contrast, the
              VISA phenotype was detected in fewer than 1\% of isolates.
              Deep-sequencing analysis showed that slow-VISA clones are present
              in small numbers among hVISA isolates, and proliferate in the
              presence of vancomycin. This slow-VISA subpopulation could

              pathogen. The reservoir of infecting isolates is colonization,

              identify if AMRs in colonizing MRSA populations diversified and
              potential mechanisms of resistance gene transfer in vivo.
              METHODS: Nasal swabs from 38 MRSA carriers admitted to hospital
              were plated and 20 individual colonies from each patient tested
              for phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility and genetically for
              lineage, carriage of four prophages and three plasmid families.
              Free bacteriophages were detected in swabs as well as their
              capacity for transducing resistance genes. RESULTS: Nine (24\%)
              patients carried phenotypic AMR variants and 24 (63\%) carried
              prophage and plasmid variants. If a single colony was selected
              for testing, the probability of detecting all AMR in that patient
              was 87\%. Sixty-four different AMR and mobile genetic element
              (MGE) profiles were detected, mostly in the MRSA CC22 background
              (where CC stands for clonal complex), with up to 8 profiles per
              patient. Nearly half of the patients carried detectable free
              bacteriophages and phages successfully transduced resistance
              genes between laboratory and patient isolates in vitro. WGS
              showed MRSA core genomes were stable, while AMR and MGEs varied.
              CONCLUSIONS: 'Clouds' of MRSA variants that have acquired or lost
              AMR and MGEs are common in nasal colonizing populations and
              bacteriophages may play an important role in gene transfer.
              Accurate estimation of AMR and genetic variability has
              implications for diagnostics, epidemiology, antimicrobial

              resistance data. Geospatial visualization of the data is made

              a public health emergency of global concern, threatening medical
              intervention at every level of health care delivery. Several
              recent studies have demonstrated the promise of routine
              whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens for
              epidemiological surveillance, outbreak detection, and infection
              control. However, as this technology becomes more widely adopted,
              the key challenges of generating representative national and
              international data sets and the development of bioinformatic
              tools to manage and interpret the data become increasingly
              pertinent. This study provides a road map for the integration of
              WGS data into routine pathogen surveillance. We emphasize the
              importance of large-scale routine surveys to provide the
              population context for more targeted or localized investigation
              and the development of open-access bioinformatic tools to provide

              hospitalised patients, rendering otherwise treatable bacterial
              infections potentially life-threatening. A thorough understanding
              of the mechanisms by which resistance spreads between patients in
              different hospitals is required in order to design effective
              control strategies. We measured the differences between bacterial
              populations of 52 hospitals in the United Kingdom and Ireland,
              using whole-genome sequences from 1085 MRSA clonal complex 22
              isolates collected between 1998 and 2012. The genetic differences
              between bacterial populations were compared with the number of
              patients transferred between hospitals and their regional
              structure. The MRSA populations within single hospitals, regions
              and countries were genetically distinct from the rest of the
              bacterial population at each of these levels. Hospitals from the
              same patient referral regions showed more similar MRSA
              populations, as did hospitals sharing many patients. Furthermore,
              the bacterial populations from different time-periods within the
              same hospital were generally more similar to each other than
              contemporaneous bacterial populations from different hospitals.
              We conclude that, while a large part of the dispersal and
              expansion of MRSA takes place among patients seeking care in
              single hospitals, inter-hospital spread of resistant bacteria is
              by no means a rare occurrence. Hospitals are exposed to constant
              introductions of MRSA on a number of levels: (1) most MRSA is
              received from hospitals that directly transfer large numbers of
              patients, while (2) fewer introductions happen between regions or
              (3) across national borders, reflecting lower numbers of
              transferred patients. A joint coordinated control effort between
              hospitals, is therefore paramount for the national control of

              to confirm or refute hospital/ward outbreaks of
              methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) identified
              through routine practice. However, appropriately targeted WGS
              strategies that identify routinely ``undetectable'' transmission
              remain the ultimate aim.MethodsWGS of MRSA isolates sent to a
              regional microbiological laboratory was performed as part of a
              12-month prospective observational study. Phylogenetic analyses
              identified a genetically related cluster of E-MRSA15 isolated
              from patients registered to the same general practice (GP)
              surgery. This led to an investigation to identify epidemiological
              links, find additional cases, and determine potential for ongoing
              transmission.ResultsWe identified 15 MRSA-positive individuals
              with 27 highly related MRSA isolates who were linked to the GP
              surgery, 2 of whom died with MRSA bacteremia. Of the 13 cases
              that were further investigated, 11 had attended a leg
              ulcer/podiatry clinic. Cases lacked epidemiological links to
              hospitals, suggesting that transmission occurred elsewhere.
              Environmental and staff screening at the GP surgery did not
              identify an ongoing source of infection.ConclusionsSurveillance
              in the United Kingdom shows that the proportion of MRSA
              bacteremias apportioned to hospitals is decreasing, suggesting
              the need for greater focus on the detection of MRSA outbreaks and
              transmission in the community. This case study confirms that the
              typically nosocomial lineage (E-MRSA15) can transmit within
              community settings. Our study exemplifies the continued
              importance of WGS in detecting outbreaks, including those which
              may be missed by routine practice, and suggests that universal
              WGS of bacteremia isolates may help detect outbreaks in
              low-surveillance settings.",

  author   = "Kumar, Krishan and Chen, John and Drlica, Karl and Shopsin, Bo",
  abstract = "The agr system of Staphylococcus aureus promotes invasion of host
              tissues, and as expected, agents that block agr quorum sensing
              have anti-infective properties. Paradoxically, agr-defective
              mutants are frequently recovered from patients, especially those
              persistently infected with S. aureus. We found that an agr
              deficiency increased survival of cultured bacteria during severe
              stress, such as treatment with gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, heat,
              or low pH. With daptomycin, deletion of agr decreased survival.
              Therefore, agr activity can be either detrimental or protective,
              depending on the type of lethal stress. Deletion of agr had no
              effect on the ability of the antimicrobials to block bacterial
              growth, indicating that agr effects are limited to lethal action.
              Thus, the effect of an agr deletion is on bacterial tolerance,
              not resistance. For gentamicin and daptomycin, activity can be
              altered by agr-regulated secreted factors. For ciprofloxacin, a
              detrimental function was downregulation of glutathione peroxidase
              (bsaA), an enzyme responsible for defense against oxidative
              stress. Deficiencies in agr and bsaA were epistatic for survival,
              consistent with agr having a destructive role mediated by
              reactive oxygen species. Enhanced susceptibility to lethal stress
              by wild-type agr, particularly antimicrobial stress, helps
              explain why inactivating mutations in S. aureus agr commonly
              occur in hospitalized patients during infection. Moreover, the
              agr quorum-sensing system of S. aureus provides a clinically
              relevant example in which a single-step change in the response to
              severe stress alters the evolutionary path of a pathogen during
              infection.IMPORTANCE When phenotypes produced in response to an
              environmental stress are inadequate to buffer against that
              stress, changes that do buffer may become genetically encoded by
              natural selection. A clinically relevant example is seen with S.
              aureus mutants that are deficient in the key virulence regulator
              agr. Paradoxically, defects in agr are selected during serious
              hospital infection and have been associated with worse outcome.
              The current work helps resolve this paradox: agr mutants are
              often less readily killed by lethal stressors without affecting
              MIC, a phenomenon known as tolerance. Our results indicate that
              tolerance, which would not be detected as resistance, can be
              selected in clinical settings. The data also support the ideas
              that (i) S. aureus broadly hedges against environmental change
              and stress through genome plasticity, (ii) reactive oxygen can be
              involved in the self-destructive response in bacteria, and (iii)
              therapeutic targeting of agr and virulence can be
              counterproductive.",

              the 6 contigs related to the SCC element, one comprised a
              recombinase gene ccrAA, ccrC-PM1, fusC and a helicase, another
              one included mvaS, dru, mecA and 1 had yobV and Q4LAG7. The SCC
              element had 5 transposase genes, namely 3 identical paralogs of
              tnpIS431 and 2 identical paralogs of tnpIS256. Two identical
              copies of a tnpIS256-based insertion element flank the aacA-aphD
              gene. Two copies of this insertion element were present with 1
              located in the SCC element and another inserted into the sasC
              gene. A short 3 kb region, which lacks any bacteriophage
              structural genes and site-specific DNA integrase, was inserted
              into the hlb gene. The hsdM and the 5'-part of the hsdS gene are
              replaced by a copy of the hsdM/hsdS paralogs from $\nu$Sa$\beta$
              giving rise to a new chimeric paralog of hsdS in $\nu$Sa$\alpha$.
              CONCLUSION: CC15-MRSA shows a novel SCCmecV/SCCfus composite
              element. Its variant of hsdM/hsdS probably facilitated uptake of
              foreign mobile genetic elements that promoted emergence of
              CC15-MRSA. Close surveillance is needed to monitor spread and
              emergence of further CC15 MRSA strains.",

              has declined over the past decade, but it is unclear whether this

              trends in the annual rates of infection by S. aureus subtype and
              mean antibiotic resistance, we conducted a 15-year retrospective
              observational study at two tertiary care institutions in Boston,

              clinical specimens. We inferred gain and loss of methicillin
              resistance through genome sequencing of 180 isolates from 2016.
              Annual rates of infection by S. aureus declined from 2003 to 2014
              by 4.2\% (2.7\%-5.6\%), attributable to an annual decline in MRSA
              of 10.9\% (9.3\%-12.6\%). Penicillin-susceptible S. aureus (PSSA)
              increased by 6.1\% (4.2\%-8.1\%) annually and rates of
              methicillin-susceptible, penicillin-resistant S. aureus (MSSA)
              did not change. Resistance in S. aureus decreased from 2000 to
              2014 by 0.8 antibiotics (0.7-0.8). Within common MRSA clonal
              complexes, 3/14 MSSA and 2/21 PSSA isolates arose from the loss
              of resistance-conferring genes. Overall, in two tertiary care
              institutions in Boston, MA, a decline in S. aureus infections has
              been accompanied by a shift towards increased antibiotic

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus argenteus and S. schweitzeri, were
              recently proposed as novel species within S. aureus complex
              (SAC). S. argenteus has been reported in many countries and can
              threaten human health. S. schweitzeri has not been associated
              with human infections, but has been isolated from non-human
              primates. Questions regarding the evolution of pathogenicity of
              these two species will remain elusive until an exploratory
              evolutionary framework is established. RESULTS: We present
              genomic comparison analysis among members of SAC based on a
              pan-genome definition, which included 15 S. argenteus genomes
              (five newly sequenced), six S. schweitzeri genomes and 30
              divergent S. aureus genomes. The three species had divergent core
              genomes and rare interspecific recombination was observed among
              the core genes. However, some subtypes of staphylococcal cassette
              chromosome mec (SCCmec) elements and prophages were present in
              different species. Of 111 tested virulence genes of S. aureus, 85
              and 86 homologous genes were found in S. argenteus and S.
              schweitzeri, respectively. There was no difference in virulence
              gene content among the three species, but the sequence of most
              core virulence genes was divergent. Analysis of the agr locus and
              the genes in the capsular polysaccharides biosynthetic operon
              revealed that they both diverged before the speciation of SAC
              members. Furthermore, the widespread geographic distribution of
              S. argenteus, sequence type 2250, showed ambiguous
              biogeographical structure among geographically isolated
              populations, demonstrating an international spread of this
              pathogen. CONCLUSIONS: S. argenteus has spread among several
              countries, and invasive infections and persistent carriage may be
              not limited to currently reported regions. S. argenteus probably
              had undergone a recent host adaption and can cause human
              infections with a similar pathogenic potential.",

              aureus infection is high in low- and middle-income countries
              presumably due to limited resources, misuse of antibiotics and
              poor infection control. The objective of the present study was to
              apply population genomics to precisely define, for the first
              time, the transmission of antibiotic resistant S. aureus in a
              resource-limited setting in sub-Saharan Africa.
              Methods:Staphylococcus aureus surveillance was performed amongst
              burn patients and healthcare workers during a 7-months survey
              within the burn unit of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Ghana.
              Results: Sixty-six S. aureus isolates (59 colonizing and 7
              clinical) were obtained from 31 patients and 10 healthcare
              workers. Twenty-one of these isolates were ST250-IV
              methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Notably, 25 (81\%) of the
              31 patients carried or were infected with S. aureus within 24 h
              of admission. Genome comparisons revealed six distinct S. aureus
              clones circulating in the burn unit, and demonstrated multiple
              transmission events between patients and healthcare workers.
              Further, the collected S. aureus isolates exhibited a wide range
              of genotypic resistances to antibiotics, including trimethoprim
              (21\%), aminoglycosides (33\%), oxacillin (33\%), chloramphenicol
              (50\%), tetracycline (59\%) and fluoroquinolones (100\%).
              Conclusion: Population genomics uncovered multiple transmission
              events of S. aureus, especially MRSA, within the investigated
              burn unit. Our findings highlight lapses in infection control and
              prevention, and underscore the great importance of active

              to disrupt genes, alter gene expressions, and cause genomic
              rearrangements. ``Canonical'' ISs have historically been
              characterized by their terminal inverted repeats (IRs), which may
              form a stem-loop structure, and duplications of a short (non-IR)
              target sequence at both ends, called target site duplications

              Staphylococcus aureus genomes in familial infection cases are
              unclear. Here, we determined the complete circular genome
              sequences of familial strains from a Panton-Valentine leukocidin

              and parent strain (GN3) were rich for ``canonical'' IS1272 with
              terminal IRs, both having 13 commonly-existing copies

              copies of ni-IS1272 within the DNA helicase gene and near rot.
              The GN3 genome also had a small deletion. The targets of
              ni-IS1272 transposition were IR structures, in contrast with
              previous ``canonical'' ISs. There were no TSDs. Based on a
              database search, the targets for ce-IS1272 were IRs or
              ``non-IRs''. IS1272 included a larger structure with tandem
              duplications of the left (IRL) side sequence; tnp included minor
              cases of a long fusion form and truncated form. One ce-IS1272 was
              associated with the segments responsible for immune evasion and

              peptides (phenol-soluble modulin $\alpha$ and $\delta$-hemolysin)
              and PVL more strongly than some other familial strains. These

              ``canonical'' transpositions, resulting in genomic variations,

              grossly in the expression of this toxin. For that reason, both

              Both genomes include a circular plasmid of 27,490 nucleotides.
              The sequence of the G477 chromosome maps nearly exactly to

              staphylococcal bacteriophages (phages) belonging to the genus
              Twortlikevirus (staphylococcal Twort-like phages) are regarded as
              ideal candidates for clinical application for Staphylococcus
              aureus infections due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant
              bacteria of this species. To increase the usability of these
              phages, it is necessary to understand the mechanism underlying
              host recognition, especially the receptor-binding proteins (RBPs)
              that determine host range. In this study, we found that the
              staphylococcal Twort-like phage $\Phi$SA012 possesses at least
              two RBPs. Genomic analysis of five mutant phages of $\Phi$SA012
              revealed point mutations in orf103, in a region unique to
              staphylococcal Twort-like phages. Phages harboring mutated ORF103
              could not infect S. aureus strains in which wall teichoic acids
              (WTAs) are glycosylated with $\alpha$-N-acetylglucosamine
              ($\alpha$-GlcNAc). A polyclonal antibody against ORF103 also
              inhibited infection by $\Phi$SA012 in the presence of
              $\alpha$-GlcNAc, suggesting that ORF103 binds to $\alpha$-GlcNAc.
              In contrast, a polyclonal antibody against ORF105, a short tail
              fiber component previously shown to be an RBP, inhibited phage
              infection irrespective of the presence of $\alpha$-GlcNAc.
              Immunoelectron microscopy indicated that ORF103 is a tail fiber
              component localized at the bottom of the baseplate. From these
              results, we conclude that ORF103 binds $\alpha$-GlcNAc in WTAs,

              backbone. These findings provide insight into the infection
              mechanism of staphylococcal Twort-like phages. IMPORTANCE:
              Staphylococcus phages belonging to the genus Twortlikevirus
              (called staphylococcal Twort-like phages) are considered
              promising agents for control of Staphylococcus aureus due to
              their wide host range and highly lytic capabilities. Although
              staphylococcal Twort-like phages have been studied widely for
              therapeutic purposes, the host recognition process of
              staphylococcal Twort-like phages remains unclear. This work
              provides new findings about the mechanisms of host recognition of
              the staphylococcal Twort-like phage $\Phi$SA012. The details of
              the host recognition mechanism of $\Phi$SA012 will allow us to
              analyze the mechanisms of infection and expand the utility of
              staphylococcal Twort-like phages for the control of S. aureus.",

              it emerged in the early 2000s, but its geographic origin is
              obscure. Here we use the population genomic signatures expected
              from the serial founder effects of a geographic range expansion
              to infer the origin of USA300-NAE and identify polymorphisms
              associated with its spread. Genome sequences from 357 isolates
              from 22 U.S. states and territories and seven other countries are
              compared. We observe two significant signatures of range
              expansion, including decreases in genetic diversity and increases
              in derived allele frequency with geographic distance from the
              Pennsylvania region. These signatures account for approximately
              half of the core nucleotide variation of this clone, occur genome
              wide, and are robust to heterogeneity in temporal sampling of
              isolates, human population density, and recombination detection
              methods. The potential for positive selection of a gyrA
              fluoroquinolone resistance allele and several intergenic regions,
              along with a 2.4 times higher recombination rate in a resistant
              subclade, is noted. These results are the first to show a pattern
              of genetic variation that is consistent with a range expansion of
              an epidemic bacterial clone, and they highlight a rarely
              considered but potentially common mechanism by which genetic
              drift may profoundly influence bacterial genetic
              variation.IMPORTANCE The process of geographic spread of an
              origin population by a series of smaller populations can result
              in distinctive patterns of genetic variation. We detect these
              patterns for the first time with an epidemic bacterial clone and
              use them to uncover the clone's geographic origin and variants
              associated with its spread. We study the USA300 clone of
              methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which was first
              noticed in the early 2000s and subsequently became the leading
              cause of skin and soft tissue infections in the United States.
              The eastern United States is the most likely origin of epidemic
              USA300. Relatively few variants, which include an antibiotic
              resistance mutation, have persisted during this clone's spread.
              Our study suggests that an early chapter in the genetic history

              reduce morbidity and mortality. Whole genome sequencing (WGS)
              performed directly from liquid blood culture could provide
              single-assay species and antibiotic susceptibility prediction;
              however, high inhibitor and human cell/DNA concentrations limit
              pathogen recovery. We develop a method for the preparation of
              bacterial DNA for WGS-based diagnostics direct from liquid blood
              culture. METHODOLOGY: We evaluate three commercial DNA extraction
              kits: BiOstic Bacteraemia, Amplex Hyplex and MolYsis Plus.
              Differential centrifugation, filtration, selective lysis and
              solid-phase reversible immobilization bead clean-up are tested to
              improve human cells/DNA and inhibitor removal. Using WGS
              (Illumina/MinION), we assess human DNA removal, pathogen
              recovery, and predict species and antibiotic susceptibility
              inpositive blood cultures of 44 Gram-negative and 54
              Staphylococcus species.Results/Key findings. BiOstic kit
              extractions yield the greatest mean DNA concentration, 94-301 ng
              µl-1, versus 0-2.5 ng µl-1using Amplex and MolYsis kits. However,
              we note higher levels of inhibition (260/280 ratio 0.9-2.1) and
              human DNA (0.0-4.4$\times$106 copies) in BiOstic extracts.
              Differential centrifugation (2000 g, 1 min) prior to BiOstic
              extraction reduces human DNA by 63-89 \% with selective lysis
              minimizing by a further 62 \%. Post-extraction bead clean-up
              lowers inhibition. Overall, 67 \% of sequenced samples (Illumina
              MiSeq) contain 93 \% concordance between WGS-based species and
              susceptibility predictions and clinical diagnosis. If >60 \% of
              sequencing reads are human (7/98 samples) susceptibility
              prediction becomes compromised. Novel MinION-based WGS (n=9)
              currently gives rapid species identification but not
              susceptibility prediction. CONCLUSION: Our method for DNA
              preparation allows WGS-based diagnosis direct from blood culture
              bottles, providing species and antibiotic susceptibility

  abstract = "Excess copper is highly toxic and forms part of the host innate
              immune system's antibacterial arsenal, accumulating at sites of
              infection and acting within macrophages to kill engulfed
              pathogens. We show for the first time that a novel, horizontally
              gene transferred copper resistance locus (copXL), uniquely
              associated with the SCCmec elements of the highly virulent,
              epidemic, community acquired methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
              aureus (CA-MRSA) USA300, confers copper hyper-resistance. These
              genes are additional to existing core genome copper resistance
              mechanisms, and are not found in typical S. aureus lineages, but
              are increasingly identified in emerging pathogenic isolates. Our
              data show that CopX, a putative P1B-3-ATPase efflux transporter,
              and CopL, a novel lipoprotein, confer copper hyper-resistance
              compared to typical S. aureus strains. The copXL genes form an
              operon that is tightly repressed in low copper environments by
              the copper regulator CsoR. Significantly, CopX and CopL are
              important for S. aureus USA300 intracellular survival within
              macrophages. Therefore the emergence of new S. aureus clones with
              the copXL locus has significant implications for public health
              because these genes confer increased resistance to antibacterial
              copper toxicity, enhancing bacterial fitness by altering S.
